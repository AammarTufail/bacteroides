Here, we extracted crude polysaccharides from the leaves of P. sibiricum and further separated and purified them to study the effects of P. sibiricum polysaccharides (PsPs) on intestinal microbes and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). The PsPs had a total sugar content of 97.48% and a monosaccharide composition comprising mannose, rhamnose, galacturonic acid, glucose, xylose, and arabinose, with molar ratios of 6.6:15.4:4.5:8.8:40.7:24, respectively. The effects of PsPs on intestinal microflora in mice were also studied, with 16S sequencing results showing an increase in the relative abundance of Firmicutes and a decrease in Bacteroidetes at the phylum level. The abundance of Lactobacillus increased, while those of Lachnospiraceae and Bacteroides reduced (at the genus level) by PsPs treatment. The composition of microbes changed. Levels of SCFAs in the PsPs group were significantly increased compared with control mice, including acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid. These results suggest that PsPs can act as prebiotics, regulating the intestinal tract probiotics. © 2022, The Author(s).",

These conditions are a major source of morbidity and decreased quality of life prior to cancer treatment, but poorly defined etiologies impede successful treatment. The gastrointestinal microbiota shape inflammation, influence cancer progression and treatment, and colonize tumors. However, research has not directly determined if peripheral tumors influence the microbiome and intestinal physiology, thus influencing gastrointestinal and behavioral symptoms. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine consequences of orthotopic, syngeneic mammary tumor implantation, growth, and resection on fecal bacteriome composition and intestinal barrier function in relation to systemic inflammation and enteric bacterial translocation in mice. Methods: Female mice were randomized to 3 experimental groups: sham surgical control, tumor recipients, and tumor recipients later receiving tumor-resection. Mice were sacrificed three weeks after tumor implantation or resection for collection of stool, colon, spleen, and brain tissue and analysis. Results: Tumor-bearing mice exhibited several markers of colonic barrier disruption, including dampened expression of tight junction proteins (Cldn1 and Ocln) and elevated circulating lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP). Compromised colonic barrier integrity was associated with altered fecal bacterial profiles in tumor-mice, including lower relative abundance of Lactobacillus, but higher Bacteroides. Consistent with colonic barrier disruption and altered microbiomes, tumor-mice displayed markers of systemic inflammation including splenomegaly, higher splenic bacterial load, and elevated splenic and brain pro-inflammatory cytokines. Several bacteria cultured from spleens had 16S rRNA gene amplicons matching those in fecal samples, suggesting they were of intestinal origin. Fecal Lactobacillus was highly-interrelated to physiological parameters disrupted by tumors via correlation network analysis. Tumor resection ameliorated circulating LBP, splenomegaly, and splenic cytokines, but not other parameters associated with loss of colonic barrier integrity and bacterial translocation. Conclusions: Orthotopic mammary tumors alter the microbiome, reduce intestinal barrier function, increase translocation of enteric bacteria, and alter systemic inflammation. This provides insight into how tumors commence gastrointestinal and behavioral symptoms prior to treatment, and identify targets for future therapeutics, such as probiotic Lactobacillus supplementation. © 2022, The Author(s).",

Here, nutritional profile, digestion and colonic fermentation of L. squarrosulus powder (LP) were determined. The powder contained mainly carbohydrate and protein. SEM and F-TIR analysis of the resistant hydrolysate (RH) revealed that the structure and ratio of carbohydrate and protein components were altered, and released known immunomodulation agents; beta-glucans and mannose. Both LP and RH promoted selected probiotic bacteria, especially Bifidobacterium strains. Using fecal microbiota of five volunteers (V1, V2, V3, V4 and V5), RH stimulated the microbiota of all used volunteers, via decreasing the ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ranging from 1.3 to 8.2 times. Also, RH increased the relative abundance of vital immunomodulators; Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium cluster XIVa and IV, and Sutterella. Additionally, RH fermentation enriched the content of branch-chain fatty acids (BCFA) and short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), indicating protein and carbohydrate usage. Notably, propionic and butyric acids were abundant in V1, V2 and V3, while in V4 and V5, acetic and butyric acids were most enriched.

Yet in studies of the gut microbiome, bacterial density is rarely reported. Studies of hospitalized patients commonly use rectal swabs for microbiome analysis, yet variation in their bacterial density—and the clinical and methodologic significance of this variation—remains undetermined. We used an ultra-sensitive quantification approach—droplet digital PCR (ddPCR)—to quantify bacterial density in rectal swabs from 118 hospitalized patients. We compared bacterial density with bacterial community composition (via 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing) and clinical data to determine if variation in bacterial density has methodological, clinical, and prognostic significance. Results: Bacterial density in rectal swab specimens was highly variable, spanning five orders of magnitude (1.2 × 104–3.2 × 109 16S rRNA gene copies/sample). Low bacterial density was strongly correlated with the detection of sequencing contamination (Spearman ρ = − 0.95, p &lt; 10−16). Low-density rectal swab communities were dominated by peri-rectal skin bacteria and sequencing contaminants (p &lt; 0.01), suggesting that some variation in bacterial density is explained by sampling variation. Yet bacterial density was also associated with important clinical exposures, conditions, and outcomes. Bacterial density was lower among patients who had received piperacillin-tazobactam (p = 0.017) and increased among patients with multiple medical comorbidities (Charlson score, p = 0.0040) and advanced age (p = 0.043). Bacterial density at the time of hospital admission was independently associated with subsequent extraintestinal infection (p = 0.0028), even when controlled for severity of illness and comorbidities. Conclusions: The bacterial density of rectal swabs is highly variable, and this variability is of methodological, clinical, and prognostic significance. Microbiome studies using rectal swabs are vulnerable to sequencing contamination and should include appropriate negative sequencing controls. Among hospitalized patients, gut bacterial density is associated with clinical exposures (antibiotics, comorbidities) and independently predicts infection risk. Bacterial density is an important and under-studied feature of gut microbiome community analysis. [MediaObject not available: see fulltext.] © 2022, The Author(s).",1.0

The effect of active Bifidobacterium tablet (Siliankang) on intestinal flora of pregnant women and reaction to early pregnancy was analyzed. A real-time fetal heart rate monitoring method was established based on median filtering algorithm, and a maternal and infant monitoring system was established by organically combining portable monitoring equipment and hospital monitoring center through the IoT. Fe3O4 nanoparticles and Au-NPs were prepared by co-precipitation method and Turkevitch-Frens method. Fe3O4-Au-SiO2 NPs was obtained by polymerizing Au-NPs into Fe3O4 nanoparticles and coating the surface with SiO2. The characterization of NPs and its bacterial adsorption efficiency were analyzed, and a capture sensor for the detection of bacterial Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was prepared. A total of 120 patients with pregnancy reaction were selected as the research object, and were divided into the placebo group and the experimental group (compound probiotics supplement group) according to different treatment methods, with 60 patients in each group. The bacterial DNA detection sensor was used to detect the difference of bacterial flora in feces of patients in different groups. The results showed that the particle size of Fe3O4-Au-SiO2 NPs was 15–47 nm, and the adsorption efficiency of Fe3O4-Au-SiO2 NPs to S. aureus, S. epidermidi, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa was higher than 80%. The Fe3O4-Au-SiO2 NPs of the prepared bacterial DNA detection sensor could be hybridized with the target bacterial DNA sequence. the intestinal enterobacteria, enterococci, and Bacteroides of patients in test group were remarkably reduced in contrast to control group, while the Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Fusobacterium flora were greatly increased (P &lt; 0.05). the number of NVP patients in the control group and test group was 19 case (31.7%) and 5 case (8.3%). The probability of early pregnancy reaction was notably reduced (P &lt; 0.05). It showed that the maternal and infant monitoring system based on Internet of things technology had potential application value for maternal and infant health. Tetralogy of viable Bifidobacterium tablets (Siliankang) can reduce the pathogenic bacteria in the intestines of pregnant women, and then reduced the incidence of early pregnancy reactions. © 2022",

Previous studies have shown that the metabolic improvement of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced mice by buckwheat is correlated with gut microbiota; however, the anti-hyperlipidemia effects and potential mechanism of probiotics-fermented rice buckwheat (FRB) are not well understood. Here, we aimed to investigate the lipid-lowering and gut microbiota regulation of FRB in HFD-induced hyperlipidemic mice. We observed that probiotic fermentation markedly increased the contents of γ-aminobutyric acid, rutin, total polyphenols, and total flavonoids in rice buckwheat. FRB supplementation over eight weeks significantly reduced body weight gain and visceral obesity, as well as alleviating dyslipidemia in HFD-fed mice. Moreover, FRB treatment effectively ameliorated oxidative stress and chronic inflammation. We further demonstrated that FRB intervention significantly inhibited hepatic cholesterol synthesis and lipogenesis, and promoted lipolysis. More important, FRB treatment reversed HFD-induced gut dysbiosis by decreasing the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes and increasing the abundance of SCFA-producing bacteria such as Bacteroides, Lactobacillus, and Blautia, along with increasing the total SCFAs contents. Overall, these results show that FRB is a beneficial nutraceutical for hyperlipidemia amelioration. © 2022",

This study aimed to evaluate the potential effect of whey protein hydrolysate (WPH) on the infant gut microbiome, which is more variable than that of adults. Colonic fermentation was simulated through a static digestion model and fecal culture fermentation, using feces from normal infants aged from 1–3 years old. During in vitro gut fermentation, measurements of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) concentrations and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing were performed. Additionally, the growth curves of cultivated probiotics were analyzed to evaluate the prebiotic potential of WPH. Besides the decline of pH in fermentation, the addition of WPH induced a significant increase in the SCFA production and also the relative abundance of Proteobacteria, Bacteroides, and Streptococcus (p < 0.05). The lower ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes in WPH-supplemented samples indicated the positive modulation of WPH on the gut microbiota, which could benefit the energy balance and metabolism of infants. The stimulation effect of WPH on the probiotics (particularly Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM) during cultivation implied the prebiotic potential as well. Our findings shed light on WPH as a valuable dietary supplement with not only enriched resources of essential amino acids but also the potential to restore the infant gut microbiome. © 2022 by the authors.

The results demonstrated a higher impact of S. platensis biomass than fructooligosaccharide (FOS), an established prebiotic. Higher L. acidophilus proliferation rates and metabolic activity were observed (lower pH values and higher concentrations of acetic, lactic, and propionic acids) in the presence of S. platensis. Then, we evaluated the effects of the S. platensis biomass (1.5 g, twice a day, 5 days) in association with L. acidophilus (106 CFU/g) on the gut microbiota composition of medium-age healthy individuals through the Simulator of Human Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem (SHIME®) and measurement of metabolites. L. acidophilus (La5) and L. acidophilus + S. platensis (Spi-La5) could positively modulate the intestinal microbiota. The administration of La5 resulted in increases in Bacteroides, Megasphaera, Lactobacillus, and Parabacteroides genus abundance, with a consequent decrease in ammonium ions. The administration of Spi-La5 increased the abundance of the genus Erysipelatoclostridium, Roseburia, Enterococcus, Bifidobacterium, Coriobacteriaceae UCG-003, Enterobacter, and Paraclostridium. The results demonstrate that the intestinal microbiota was differently modified by administrating La5 and Spi-La5 and indicate the latter as an alternative for microbiota positive modulation in healthy individuals. © 2021",1.0

Gut microbiota plays a crucial role in immunotherapy sensitisation and Panax ginseng has been shown to possess immunomodulatory potential. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether the combination treatment of ginseng polysaccharides (GPs) and αPD-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) could sensitise the response by modulating gut microbiota. Design Syngeneic mouse models were administered GPs and αPD-1 mAb, the sensitising antitumour effects of the combination therapy on gut microbiota were assessed by faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and 16S PacBio single-molecule real-Time (SMRT) sequencing. To assess the immune-related metabolites, metabolomics analysis of the plasma samples was performed. Results We found GPs increased the antitumour response to αPD-1 mAb by increasing the microbial metabolites valeric acid and decreasing L-kynurenine, as well as the ratio of Kyn/Trp, which contributed to the suppression of regulatory T cells and induction of T eff cells after combination treatment. Besides, the microbial analysis indicated that the abundance of Parabacteroides distasonis and Bacteroides vulgatus was higher in responders to anti-PD-1 blockade than non-responders in the clinic. Furthermore, the combination therapy sensitised the response to PD-1 inhibitor in the mice receiving microbes by FMT from six non-responders by reshaping the gut microbiota from non-responders towards that of responders. Conclusion Our results demonstrate that GPs combined with αPD-1 mAb may be a new strategy to sensitise non-small cell lung cancer patients to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. The gut microbiota can be used as a novel biomarker to predict the response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. © 2022 BMJ Publishing Group. All rights reserved.",16.0

Thymus and spleen indices were calculated while the alleviation of the colon and liver histopathological progression was evaluated by H&E staining. The data indicated that DOLP improved immunity status by restoring the gut barrier and atrophy of immune organs. Cytokines levels as marker of inflammation were determined using ELISA in serum and colon. Which proved that DOLP inhibited the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, TGF- β1, IL-6, IL-1β) and promoted the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10). Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) levels and microbial composition in feces were determined using GS and high-throughput sequencing. DOLP improved gut microbiota by increasing the relative abundance of total bacteria and probiotics such as Bacteroides, Lactobacillus and Lachnospiraceae. Therefore, DOLP has potential effect for the treatment of chronic immune diseases. © 2022 The Author(s)",1.0

Many studies suggest that faecal DNA metabarcoding can shield light on the host-associated microbial communities that play important roles in host health. Thus, this study aimed to characterise and compare the faecal bacterial community between captive and wild B. affinis using metabarcoding approaches. A total of seven faeces samples were collected from captive (N = 5) and wild (N = 2) adult B. affinis aseptically, crossing the East and West coast of peninsular Malaysia. The DNA was extracted from the faeces samples, and the 16S rRNA gene (V3–V4 region) was amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The amplicon was further analysed using SILVA and DADA2 pipelines. In total, 297 bacterial communities taxonomic profile (phylum to genus) were determined. Three phyla were found in high abundance in all faeces samples, namely Firmicutes (38.69%), Bacteroidetes (24.52%), and Fusobacteria (6.95%). Proteobacteria were detected in all faeces samples (39.63%), except the wild sample, KBW3. Under genus level, Cetobacteriumwas found as the most abundant genus (67.79%), followed by Bacteroides (24.56%) and Parabacteroides (21.78%). The uncultured genus had the highest abundance (88.51%) even though not detected in the BK31 and KBW2 samples.

Methods: In this study, microbial community composition and diversity analyses were carried out on fecal specimens from MG patients who did not take Fufang Huangqi Decoction (control group, n = 8) and those who took Fufang Huangqi Decoction and achieved remarkable alleviation of symptoms (medication group, n = 8). The abundance, diversity within and between habitats, taxonomic differences and corresponding discrimination markers of gut microbiota in the control group and medicated group were assessed. Results: Compared with the control group, the medicated group showed a significantly decreased abundance of Bacteroidetes (P < 0.05) and significantly increased abundance of Actinobacteria at the phylum level, a significantly decreased abundance of Bacteroidaceae (P < 0.05) and significantly increased abundance of Bifidobacteriaceae at the family level and a significantly decreased abundance of Blautia and Bacteroides (P < 0.05) and significantly increased abundance of Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus and Roseburia at the genus level. Compared to the control group, the medicated group had decreased abundance, diversity, and genetic diversity of the communities and increased coverage, but the differences were not significant (P > 0.05); the markers that differed significantly between communities at the genus level and influenced the differences between groups were Blautia, Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus. Conclusions: MG patients have obvious gut microbiota-associated metabolic disorders. Fufang Huangqi Decoction regulates the gut microbiota in patients with class I or II MG by reducing the abundance of Blautia and Bacteroides and increasing the abundance of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus.

Excessive plasma trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), an intestinal metabolite, promotes the development of atherosclerosis. Therefore, effective measures for reducing plasma TMAO production can contribute to preventing atherosclerosis. Probiotics are living microorganisms that are beneficial to the human body, and some of them can attenuate plasma TMAO production. To explore the effects of probiotic supplementation on plasma TMAO in choline-fed mice, we intragastrically administered eight strains of Bifidobacterium breve and eight strains of Bifidobacterium longum to mice for 6 weeks. B. breve Bb4 and B. longum BL1 and BL7 significantly reduced plasma TMAO and plasma and cecal trimethylamine concentrations. However, hepatic flavin monooxygenase (FMO) activity, flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3), farnesoid X receptor (FXR) protein expression and TMAO fractional excretion were not significantly affected by Bifidobacterium supplementation. The treatment of Bifidobacterium strains modulated the abundances of several genera such as Ruminococcaceae UCG-009, Ruminococcaceae UCG-010, which belong to the Firmicutes that has been reported with cut gene clusters, which may be related to the reduction in intestinal TMA and plasma TMAO. Additionally, a reduction in Ruminococcaceae indicates a reduction in circulating glucose and lipids, which may be another pathway by which Bifidobacterium strains reduce the risk of atherosclerosis. The effect of Bifidobacterium strains on Bacteroides also suggests a relationship between the abundance of this genus and TMA concentrations in the gut. Therefore, the mechanism underlying these changes might be gut microbiota regulation. These Bifidobacterium strains may have therapeutic potential for alleviating TMAO-related diseases. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",

Furthermore, RES-sulfate and RES-glucuronide were below the detectable limit in the feces of conventional mice, with dihydroresveratrol being the dominant metabolite. Compared to the conventional mice, the ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroides and the abundance of Lactobacillus genera were found significantly elevated in colitis mice after long-term ingestion of RSV, which shifted the metabolism of RSV in return.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of dietary glucose oxidase and its combined effects with Bacillus amyloliquefaciens SC06 (BaSC06) on the intestinal microbiota, immune function and antioxidant capacity of broilers. One-day-old male Lingnan yellow-feathered broilers (n = 720) were randomly assigned to four treatment groups: Control group (basal diet), Anti group (basal diet supplemented with 200 mg/kg enramycin), GOD group (basal diet supplemented with 75 U/kg GOD), and combination of GOD and BaSC06 (GB) group (GOD diet (75 U/kg) supplemented with 1 × 108 colony-forming units BaSC06/kg feed), with six replicates per group and 30 birds per replicate. The experiment was conducted over 52 days. The results indicated a significant decrease in α-diversity (Observed species, Chao1, PD_whole_tree and Shannon) with GOD treatment, compared with the control group. GB treatment also significantly decreased the Shannon index of cecal microbiota. GOD treatment significantly decreased the α-diversity, whereas GB treatment significantly increased these indices except for the Chao1 index, compared with the Anti group. Compared with the control group, the relative abundance of Bacteroides in the GOD and GB groups was significantly increased, whereas a decrease in Firmicutes was observed. Compared with the Anti group, GOD treatment significantly increased the relative abundances of Bacteroides and Lactobacillales, while GB treatment significantly increased Lactobacillales and decreased Proteobacteria levels. In addition, GOD treatment significantly decreased interleukin-10 and interferon-γ levels, compared with the control group. In contrast, GB treatment significantly downregulated interferon-γ levels and upregulated secretory immunoglobulin A, transforming growth factor-β and interleukin-2 expression in the jejunal mucosa. GOD treatment significantly decreased transforming growth factor-β and interleukin-10 levels, whereas GB treatment markedly increased interferon-γ expression in the jejunal mucosa compared with the Anti group. Furthermore, GB treatment significantly increased the total antioxidant capability levels and the total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities compared with the control group. Meanwhile, GOD treatment significantly increased glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity in the jejunal mucosa. Total superoxide dismutase, GSH-Px and CAT activities in the Anti group were higher than in the GOD and GB groups. The malondialdehyde levels in the control group were the highest among all groups. In conclusion, our results indicated that supplementation with GOD alone and its combination with BaSC06 in diet could increase antioxidant capacity, immune function and improve the intestinal microbiota composition of broilers. Combination treatment with GOD with BaSC06 exerted stronger effects than GOD treatment only. © 2022 The Authors",

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Gram‐negative bacteria and (1à3)‐β‐D‐glucan (BG) of fungi are the two most abundant gut microbial molecules. Due to limited data on the impact of intestinal fungi in CKD mouse models, the influences of gut fungi and Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus L34 (L34) on CKD were investigated using oral C. albicans-administered 5/6 nephrectomy (5/6Nx) mice. At 16 weeks post‐5/6Nx, Candida‐5/6Nx mice demonstrated an increase in proteinuria, serum BG, serum cytokines (tumor necrotic factor‐α; TNF‐α and interleukin‐6), alanine transaminase (ALT), and level of fecal dysbiosis (Proteobacteria on fecal microbiome) when compared to non‐Candida‐5/6Nx. However, serum creatinine, renal fibrosis, or gut barrier defect (FITC‐dextran assay and endotoxemia) remained comparable between Candida‐ versus non‐Candida‐5/6Nx. The probiotics L34 attenuated several parameters in Candida‐5/6Nx mice, including fecal dysbiosis (Proteobacteria and Bacteroides), gut leakage (fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)‐dextran), gut‐derived uremic toxin (trimethylamine‐N‐oxide; TMAO) and indoxyl sulfate; IS), cytokines, and ALT. In vitro, IS combined with LPS with or without BG enhanced the injury on Caco‐2 enterocytes (transepithelial electrical resistance and FITC‐dextran permeability) and bone marrow‐derived macrophages (supernatant cytokines (TNF‐α and interleukin‐1 β; IL‐1β) and inflammatory genes (TNF‐α, IL‐1β, aryl hydrocarbon receptor, and nuclear factor‐κB)), compared with non‐IS activation. These injuries were attenuated by the probiotics condition media. In conclusion, Candida administration worsens kidney damage in 5/6Nx mice through systemic inflammation, partly from gut dysbiosis‐induced uremic toxins, which were attenuated by the probiotics. The additive effects on cell injury from uremic toxin (IS) and microbial molecules (LPS and BG) on enterocytes and macrophages might be an important underlying mechanism. © 2022 by the authors.

Despite their genomic relatedness, S. boulardii has a distinctive cell wall oligosaccharide composition compared to baker's yeast S. cerevisiae, such as higher mannan content. Here we explore the beneficial effects of S. boulardii cell wall oligosaccharides through metabolic engineering. We increased the production of guanosine diphosphate (GDP)-mannose, the substrate for cell wall mannan biosynthesis, by perturbing glycolysis flux and overexpressing the enzymes in the GDP-mannose biosynthesis pathway. Combined with overexpression of a cell wall mannoprotein and dolichol phosphate mannose synthase, the cell wall mannan content of S. boulardii increased up to 52%. The identical engineering resulted in marginal changes in the S. cerevisiae cell wall. S. boulardii showed a higher adhesive capacity against Salmonella enterica Typhimurium than S. cerevisiae, and yeast-bacteria sedimentation rates were positively correlated with cell wall mannan contents. Besides, S. boulardii biomass selectively proliferated Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron over Clostridioides difficile more efficiently than S. cerevisiae, and the selectivity was further enhanced by amplifying the cell wall mannan. Collectively, we report the important prebiotic roles of cell wall oligosaccharides in the protective functions of S. boulardii and present a unique metabolic engineering approach to modulate the functions. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",

Antibiotic therapy through abdominal symptoms causes adverse event rates and upsetting the gastric microbiota. However, the effect of probiotic supplementation on gut microbiome change after H. pylori eradication remains unknown. Material methods: We received the data from two groups, including one group that received only standard triple therapy and another group that received S. boulardii probiotic in addition to triple therapy with the accession number: PRJEB29678 from the EBI online server. We analyzed the changes of the gut microbial community using Galaxy/CRS4 and kaiju server. Results: The dominant bacterial phyla in the study population included Bacteroides, Clostridium, Ruinoccoccus, Dorea, Faecalibacterium, Vibrio, Thermotalia, and Lactobacillus. Anaerobic bacteria such as Bacteroides and Clostridium were higher in the group receiving standard triple therapy. Moreover, the relative abundance of commensal bacteria was significantly higher in the group that received S. boulardii. Conclusion: S. boulardii is a suitable treatment option against H. pylori infection that stimulates the integrity and balance of normal microflora, which has an important role in reducing the side effects of antibiotics by strengthening the colonization of anaerobic bacteria and strengthening and supporting the commensal bacteria particularly Lactobacilli. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",

Design We used murine models of colorectal cancer and melanoma to evaluate whether oral administration of LGG improves the efficacy of ICB therapies. We performed the whole genome shotgun metagenome sequencing of intestinal contents and RNA sequencing of dendritic cells (DCs). In a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments, we further defined the immunological and molecular mechanisms of LGG-mediated antitumour immunity. Results We demonstrate that oral administration of live LGG augmented the antitumour activity of anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) immunotherapy by increasing tumour-infiltrating DCs and T cells. Moreover, the combination treatment shifted the gut microbial community towards enrichment in Lactobacillus murinus and Bacteroides uniformis, that are known to increase DC activation and CD8 + tumour recruitment. Mechanistically, treatment with live LGG alone or in combination with anti-PD-1 antibody triggered type I interferon (IFN) production in DCs, enhancing the cross-priming of antitumour CD8 + T cells. In DCs, cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)/stimulator of IFN genes (STING) was required for IFN-β induction in response to LGG, as evidenced by the significant decrease in IFN-β levels in cGAS or STING-deficient DCs. LGG induces IFN-β production via the cGAS/STING/TANK binding kinase 1/interferon regulatory factor 7 axis in DCs. Conclusion Our findings have offered valuable insight into the molecular mechanisms of live LGG-mediated antitumour immunity and establish an empirical basis for developing oral administration of live LGG as a combination agent with ICB for cancer therapies. © 2022 BMJ Publishing Group.

Patients with terminal ileal NLH may experience long-term abdominal pain, diarrhea, and abdominal distension, among other symptoms. Supplementation with probiotics could mitigate these symptoms. NLH is linked to the immune system, and it may result from accumulation of plasma-cell precursors due to a maturational defect during the development of B lymphocytes. The intestinal microbiome plays an essential role in the immune system. Thus, we speculate that the gut flora plays a key role in terminal ileal NLH. AIM To explore the correlation between intestinal flora and terminal ileal NLH. METHODS We collected mucosal biopsy samples that were obtained via colonoscopy from 15 patients with terminal ileal NLH (the test group) and 15 normal subjects (the control group). We subsequently performed 16S-rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of these samples, and the results were evaluated using alpha diversity, beta diversity and microbial composition analyses. The Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States was used to predict the metabolic pathways and orthologous groups according to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database. RESULTS Compared with the control group, the terminal ileal NLH group showed an increased alpha diversity (P < 0.05). The overall intestinal microbiota in the NLH group was significantly different from that of the control group (P < 0.05), implying that there was the dysbiosis in the terminal ileal NLH patients. The relative abundance of phylum Bacteroidetes was significantly lower in the NLH group, while that of Patescibacteria and Campilobacterota was significantly higher. The genus Bacteroides was the dominant gut microbiota in both groups, but its abundance was significantly lower in the test group than it was in the control group. Conversely, the relative abundances of Haemophilus, Streptococcus, Pseudomonas, Actinomyces, TM7X, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Parvimonas, Granulicatella, Helicobacter, and the [Eubacterium] nodatum group were significantly higher in the test group than they were in the control group. In addition, several altered metabolic pathways, orthologous groups, and modules were found. For example, the Peptidoglycan biosynthesis and Aminoacyl tRNA biosynthesis were both increased in the test group. CONCLUSION Maintaining the microbial balance and supplementing targeted protective bacteria could improve symptoms and potentially reduce the risk of lymphoma transformation in patients with terminal ileal NLH. © The Author(s) 2022.

Probiotics such as Bacillus can promote the healthy growth of marine organisms by balancing the structure of intestinal microflora. To study the effect of Bacillus as an effective probiotic on turbot in aquaculture, the growth performance, immune parameters, and intestinal microbiota of turbot were investigated in this study. The correlation between the dominant bacteria at the genus level and immune/antioxidant parameters was also analyzed. The experimental fish were categorized into the treated groups B1, B2, and B3, which were fed diets supplemented with Bacillus subtilis SMF1, Bacillus licheniformis LMF1, and Bacillus siamensis DL3, respectively; the control group (T0) was given a diet without any probiotics. The results showed that the growth performance as well as the immune and antioxidant enzyme activities of turbot were significantly (P < 0.05) improved when the fish were fed with different Bacillus species, and the order of growth performance and feed effect of turbot in each group was: B2 > B1 > B3 > T0. The specific growth rate of group B2 was 1.4 times as that of the group T0. Furthermore, the relative abundance of Bacillus in group B2 was the highest (24.18%), B. licheniformis LMF1 was more conducive to Bacillus colonization in the intestine of turbot than B. subtilis SMF1 and B. siamensis DL3. The immune and antioxidant activities of turbots in groups B2 and B3 were higher than those in group B1, owing to fewer probiotics being induced by B. subtilis SMF1. The RT-PCR analysis of immune-related genes also verified the effects of different Bacillus species. Spearman's correlation analysis at the genus level revealed that most of the immune and antioxidant parameters were significantly positively correlated with intestinal microorganisms such as Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Ralstoni, and Bacillus, while being negatively correlated with some pathogenic intestinal bacteria such as Bacteroides, Parabacteroides, and Paeniclostridium. These results could guide the rational use of different Bacillus species in aquaculture. © 2021",

We aimed to determine the effects of electroacupuncture at zusanli (ST36) on intestinal microbiota in CAG rats. Methods: In total, 42 SD rats were randomly divided into normal (NC, 10 rats) and model (MG, 32 rats) groups. Rats in the MG group were established as CAG disease models. After that, the rats in the MG group were randomly divided into CAG (10 rats), electroacupuncture (EA, 10 rats), and Vitacoenzyme (Vit, 10 rats) groups. Rats in the NC and CAG groups were subjected to a 30-min/d confinement for 4 weeks. Rats in the EA group were given electroacupuncture at zusanli for 30 min/d for 4 weeks. Rats in the Vit group were given Vitacoenzyme solution 10 ml/(kg d) for 4 weeks. Histopathological changes in the gastric mucosa were observed with hematoxylin and eosin staining, and the gene expression level of p53, Bcl-2, and c-myc was determined using the qPCR method. The 16S rDNA sequencing technique was used to determine structural changes and relative abundance expression of intestinal flora. Results: Compared with the NC group, gastric mucosal pathology in the CAG group revealed significant inflammatory infiltration, and the gastric mucosal lesions in the electroacupuncture group were improved remarkably; the expression of p53 and c-myc genes in the CAG group increased (p < 0.05), while the expression of Bcl-2 genes decreased (p < 0.05) in the EA group, that of p53 and c-myc genes decreased (p < 0.05), and that of Bcl-2 genes increased (p < 0.05). The abundance of bacteria such as Lactobacillus, Desulfobacterota, and Bacteroides pectinophilus group in the CAG group increased (p < 0.05), while that of bacteria such as Gastranaerophilales, Romboutsia, and Blautia decreased (p < 0.05). The relative abundance of Desulfobacterota and Helicobacter in the EA group decreased (p < 0.05), while that of probiotic bacteria such as Oscillospirales, Romboutsia, and Christensenellaceae increased (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Electroacupuncture at zusanli can promote the repair of pathological damage to the gastric mucosa in rats with CAG, and the mechanism might relate to the reduction in the relative abundance of harmful bacteria, increase in the relative abundance of intestinal probiotics, and regulation of the intestinal microbiota.

A total of 24 patients with insomnia disorder and 22 healthy controls were recruited. The fecal and serum samples were collected. The 16s rRNA sequencing and bioinformatics analysis were conducted to explore insomnia-related changes in the diversity, structure, and composition of the gut microbiota. UPLC-MS was performed to identify insomnia-related serum metabolites. Spearman correlation analysis was used to investigate the correlations between insomnia-related gut bacteria and the serum metabolites. Despite the nonsignificant changes in the diversity and structure of gut microbiota, insomnia disorder patients had significantly decreased family Bacteroidaceae, family Ruminococcaceae, and genus Bacteroides, along with significantly increased family Prevotellaceae and genus Prevotella, compared with healthy controls. Genus Gemmiger and genus Fusicatenibacter were dominant in patients with insomnia disorder, whereas genus Coprococcus, genus Oscillibacter, genus Clostridium XI, and family Peptostreptococcaceae were dominant in healthy controls. The UPLC-MS analysis identified 97 significantly decreased metabolites and 74 significantly increased metabolites in the serum samples of patients with insomnia disorder, compared with those of healthy controls. KEGG enrichment analysis revealed 1 significantly upregulated metabolic pathway and 16 downregulated metabolic pathways in patients with insomnia disorder. Furthermore, Spearman correlation analysis unveiled significant correlations among the altered bacteria genus and serum metabolites. Patients with insomnia disorder have differential gut microbiota and serum metabolic profiles compared with healthy controls. The alterations in gut microbiota were correlated with specific serum metabolites, suggesting that some serum metabolites might mediate gut microbiota-brain communication in the pathogenesis of insomnia disorder.

The vagina is in close contact with the external environment, which may lead to the invasion of a variety of pathogenic bacteria, affect the internal and external quality of eggs, and even increase mortality and cause economic loss. In recent years, probiotics as a substitute for antibiotics have brought economic benefits in livestock and poultry production. In the present study, we investigated the effects of vaginal administration of Bacteroides fragilis on the cloacal microbiota, vaginal transcriptome and metabolomics of chickens and evaluated the beneficial potential of B. fragilis. The results showed that B. fragilis treatment could affect the microbial composition of the cloaca. Transcriptome analysis found that the immune-related genes CCN3, HAS2, and RICTOR were upregulated, that the inflammatory genes EDNRB, TOX, and NKX2-3 were downregulated, and that DEGs were also enriched in the regulation of the inflammatory response, cellular metabolism, and synaptic response pathways. In addition, the differential metabolites were mainly related to steroid hormone biosynthesis, unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis, and arachidonic acid metabolism, and we identified associations between specific differential metabolites and genes. Overall, this study provides a theoretical basis for the application of B. fragilis as a potential probiotic in livestock and poultry production. Copyright © 2022 Chen, Yang, Zhu, Su, Li and Wang.",

It is believed to possess promising anti-inflammatory benefits. This study was conducted to elucidate the protective impact of Tibetan tea extract (TTE) on dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis in mice. Mice were split into four groups: control (C) group, Tibetan tea (T) group, DSS-induced model (CD) group, and Tibetan tea + DSS (TD) group. The intake of TTE significantly reduced the clinical symptoms of ulcerative colitis (UC) by alleviating the impact of cellular damage and reducing glandular hypertrophy and the infiltration of inflammatory cells. UC led to a prominent shift of the microbial communities in the gut. Interestingly, the beneficial microbes, such as Lactobacillus reuteri, Bifidobacterium choerinum, and Lactobacillus intestinalis, were significantly increased in TTE-treated mice when compared to any other experimental group. The transcriptome analysis revealed that the positive effect of TTE on UC could be attributed to changes in the G alpha (i) signaling pathway and the innate immune system. The genes related to inflammation and immune system pathways were differentially expressed in the TTE-treated group. Moreover, the relative expression of genes linked to the inflammatory TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway was significantly downregulated toward the level of normal control samples in the TD group. Overall, this study revealed the modulatory effect by which TTE reversed the development and severity of chronic colon damage.

The microbes in its intestinal lumen play an essential role in the growth and health of the host. However, it is still unknown how the ileal microbes affect the body weight of the host. In this study, we used Muscovy ducks as an animal model to investigate the relationship between the ileal microbes and body weight and further explore the potential mechanism. The ileum tissue and ileal contents of 200 Muscovy ducks were collected for mRNA extraction and real-time quantitative PCR, as well as DNA separation and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. With body weight being ranked, the bottom 20% (n = 40) and top 20% (n = 40) were set as the low and high groups, respectively. Our results showed that in the ileum of Muscovy ducks, the Bacteroides, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria were the predominant phyla with the 10 most abundant genera, namely Candidatus Arthromitus, Bacteroides, Streptococcus, Vibrio, Romboutsia, Cetobacterium, Clostridium sensu stricto 1, Terrisporobacter, Escherichia-Shigella, and Lactobacillus. We identified Streptococcus, Escherichia-Shigella, Candidatus Arthromitus, Bacteroides, Faecalibacterium, and Oscillospira were closely correlated to the growth of Muscovy ducks. Streptococcus and Escherichia-Shigella were negatively related to body weight (BW), while Candidatus Arthromitus, Bacteroides, Faecalibacterium, and Oscillospira were positively associated with BW. In addition, we found that the relative expression levels of tight junction proteins (Claudin 1, Claudin 2, ZO-1 and ZO-2) in the high group showed an upward trend, although this trend was not significant (P > 0.05). The expression of pro-inflammatory factors (IL-1β, IL-2 and TNF-α) decreased in the high group, while the anti-inflammatory factor IL-10 increased. Of course, except IL-2, these differences were not significant (P > 0.05). Finally, the correlation analysis showed that Escherichia-Shigella was significantly positively correlated with IL-1β (P < 0.05). These findings may provide fundamental data for the development of next-generation probiotics and assist the development of strategies for changing the gut microbiota to promote the growth performance in the duck industry.

LM742 dextran had a medium-chain structure with the molecular weight of 1394.87 kDa (DP = 7759.22) and α-1,6 and α-1,3 linkages with a 26.11 : 1 ratio. The LM742 dextran was resistent to digestive enzymes in the human gastrointestinal conditions. The individual cultivation of 30 intestinal bacteria with LM742 dextran showed the growth of Bacteroides spp., whereas in vitro human fecal fermentation with LM742 exhibited the symbiotic growth of Bacteroides spp. and beneficial bacteria such as Bifidobacterium spp. Further co-cultivation of Bacteroides xylanisolvens and several probiotics indicated that B. xylanisolvens provides a cross-feeding of dextran to probiotics. In fecal fermentation, LM742 dextran resulted in increased concentrations of short-chain fatty acids, valerate and pantothenate, but it rarely affected the conversion of betaine to trimethylamine. Lastly, LM742 dextran inhibited the adhesion of pathogenic E. coli to human epithelial cells.

Each subject took Bf-688, with one sachet in the morning and one in the evening (daily bacteria count 5 × 109 CFUs), for 8 weeks. Patients’ clinical symptoms were assessed using the Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham Rating Scale (SNAP-IV). We collected stool samples at the baseline, the 8th week, and the 12th week for gut microbiota examination. During the 8-week Bf-688 supplement period, patients’ inattention symptoms and hyperactivity/impulsive symptoms improved, and their weights and BMIs increased. For gut micro-biota, the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio (F/B ratio) decreased significantly.

Totals of 1,029,260 high-quality reads and 420,010,128 bp of sequences were obtained. Among the four groups, the alpha diversity of gut microbes was significantly higher in newborn cattle in the LS group than in those in the L, S, and D groups. Overall, the dominant phyla were Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes, whereas Bifidobacterium was the most abundant phylum in the gut of cattle in the LS group. Newborn calves from the compound probiotic groups had closely clustered gut bacterial communities and had lower rates of diarrhea. Overall, compound probiotics regulated the intestinal microbiota community structure of newborn calves and improved intestinal health. New information relevant to the prevention of diarrhea is provided by our research in newborn calves. © 2022 by the authors.",

Previous chemical and microbial composition analyses of kombucha have mainly focused on understanding their changes during fermentation. Very limited information is available regarding nutrient profiles of final kombucha products in the market. In this study, we compared the major chemicals (tea polyphe-nols, caffeine), antioxidant properties, microbial and metabolomic profiles of nine commercial kombucha products using shotgun metagenomics, internal transcribed spacer sequencing, untar-geted metabolomics, and targeted chemical assays. All of the nine kombucha products showed similar acidity but great differences in chemicals, metabolites, microbes, and antioxidant activities. Most kombucha products are dominated by the probiotic Bacillus coagulans or bacteria capable of fermentation including Lactobacillus nagelii, Gluconacetobacter, Gluconobacter, and Komagataeibacter species. We found that all nine kombuchas also contained varying levels of enteric bacteria including Bacteroides thetaiotamicron, Escherischia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacteroides fragilis, Entero-bacter cloacae complex, and Akkermansia muciniphila. The fungal composition of kombucha products was characterized by predominance of fermenting yeast including Brettanomyces species and Cyberlindnera jadinii. Kombucha varied widely in chemical content assessed by global untargeted metabolomics, with metabolomic variation being significantly associated with metagenomic pro-files. Variation in tea bases, bacteria/yeast starter cultures, and duration of fermentation may all contribute to the observed large differences in the microbial and chemical profiles of final kombucha products. © 2022 by the authors.

However, knowledge on the variety of the intestinal microbiome in newborn piglets is limited. Piglet diarrhea is a serious gastrointestinal disease with a high morbidity and mortality that causes great economic damage to the pig industry. In this study, we investigated the microbiome of various sections of the piglet intestine and compared the microbiome composition of healthy and diarrheal piglets using high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. The results showed that bacteria of the Lactobacillus genus were the most common in the ileum, while Fusobacterium and Bacteroides dominated in the rectum. Comparing the microbiome composition of healthy and diarrheal piglets revealed a reduced number of Lactobacillus bacteria as a hallmark of diarrhea, as did an increased content of representatives of the Escherichia-Shigella genus and a reduced number of Bacteroides, which indicates the contribution of these bacteria to the development of diarrhea in piglets. The relative abundance of Enterococcus bacteria was higher in the diarrhea group. Although some bacteria of this genus are commensals, a small number of species may be associated with the development of diarrhea in piglets. Therefore, our results indicate that the gut microbiome may be an important factor in the development of diarrhea in piglets. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",

This randomized, single-blind, controlled intervention study purposed to explore the effects of Lactobacillus paracasei N1115 (LP N1115) on dyslipidaemia. A total of 109 dyslipidaemia subjects were recruited and divided randomly into two groups: 52 subjects in probiotics group and 57 subjects in placebo group. Blood samples were collected to test serum lipid parameters. Fecal samples were collected to analyze the gut microbiota by Illumina Miseq sequence machine. Administration of 4 × 1010 CFU/day LP N1115 for 12 weeks was found to improve dyslipidaemia profiles by lowering serum total cholesterol (TC) (P = 0.028) and apolipoprotein B (Apo-B) (P = 0.028). A significant decrease in FPG was also found in probiotic group (P = 0.001). The Chao1 index increased significantly in probiotic group after intervention (P &lt; 0.01), which did not happen in placebo group. Shannon Index increased and Simpson index decreased significantly between groups at week 12 (P &lt; 0.001). The relative abundance of Alistipes spp. and Fusobacterium spp. decreased significantly, and the relative abundance of Faecalibacterium spp. and Lactobacillus spp. increased significantly in placebo group. The relative abundance of Megamonas spp. Faecalibacterium spp. and Lactobacillus spp. increased significantly, the relative abundance of Bacteroides spp. and Phascolarctobacterium spp. decreased significantly in probiotic group. However, the overall gut microbial structure did not change significantly from the view of Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) of Bray-Curtis distance in probiotic group. The above results showed that LP N1115 might have the potential to regulate metabolic disorders such as TC, LDL-C and FPG, and also increased some of the abundance and diversity index of gut microbiota in dyslipidemias population. However, the evidence is not strong enough. Larger sample size and longer intervention period are needed to verify the efficacy of LP N1115. The mechanism is still vague and will need further well-designed studies to clarify. © 2022",

The use of PPIs can result in disordered gut microbiota, leading to a risk of enteric infections. PPIs are frequently prescribed in the general practice setting for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), peptic ulcer disease, and related conditions. Despite the availability and widespread use of probiotics and acid-suppressing medications, the effect of PPIs-induced gastric acid suppression on the survival and colonization of probiotics bacterial species is currently unclear. We hypothesized that gastric acid suppression may improve intestinal colonization of probiotics bacterial species and probiotic intervention may have a potential role in mitigating untoward effects of PPI. Methods: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, healthy subjects were given either proton pump inhibitor (PPI, n = 15) or placebo (n = 15) over 6 weeks. All subjects then consumed multi-strain probiotics from weeks 2–6. Thirty participants (10 males, 20 females, age range: 18–56 years) were enrolled in the study. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing and untargeted metabolomics analyses were performed on stool samples collected at week 0, 2, and 6. Results: Short term PPI treatment increased the microbial abundance of Streptococcaceae (p = 0.004), Leuconostacaceae (p = 0.001), and Pasteurellaceae (p = 0.020) at family level and corresponding genus levels. The metabolomic analysis of the stools revealed a change in 10 metabolites where Gly Arg Val and phenylacetic acid were consistently increased compared to the baseline. Probiotic intervention inhibited PPI-induced microbial changes such as a decrease in Leuconostacaceae family (p = 0.01) and led to an increase in metabolite 1H-Indole-4-carbaldehyde. Notably, PPI enhanced the colonization of certain probiotic bacterial species like Streptococcus thermophilus (p < 0.05) along with other species present in the multi-strain probiotic. Conclusion: Acid suppression enhanced certain probiotic associated bacterial colonization and probiotics in turn suppressed PPI-mediated intestinal microbial alterations. Thus, probiotics in combination with PPI might be a beneficial strategy that allows probiotic colonization and suppress PPI-induced microbial perturbations.

The anti-cancer effects of kefir are highlighted. Here, lactating Wistar rats were divided into: Normal litter (NL); Kefir normal litter (KNL); Small litter (SL); Kefir small litter (KSL). The NL and SL groups received 1 mL of water/day; KNL and KSL received kefir milk daily (108 CFU/mL) during lactation. After weaning, the pups continued to receive the same treatments until 60 days. At 67 days old, colorectal carcinogenesis was induced through intraperitoneal injection of 1,2-dimethylhydrazine. At 240 days, visceral adipose tissue was higher in SL compared to NL, KNL, and KSL. Kefir intake was found to suppress the number of tumors in both KNL and KSL groups (-100% and −71.43%; p &lt; 0.01, respectively). IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and NO levels in the colon were higher in the NL and SL compared to the KNL and KSL. The gut microbiota in cecal samples of SL was enriched with Alloprevotella, Acinetobacter, and Bacteroides. In contrast, the cecal contents of KSL and KNL were higher Romboutsia. Thus, neonatal overfeeding leads to greater adiposity, inflammation and number of colon tumors in adulthood. Early-life nutrition based on kefir reverted these alterations. © 2021",

Objectives: In this study, four B. vulgatus strains were selected, based on their genomic characteristics, to assess their ability to alleviate lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute intestinal injury in C57BL/6J mice. Methods: Alterations in the intestinal microbiota, intestinal epithelial permeability, cytokine level, short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) concentration, and immune responses were investigated following LPS-induced acute intestinal injury in C57BL/6J mice. Results: Severe histological damage and a significant change in cytokine expression was observed in the mouse colon tissues 24 h after LPS administration. Oral administration of different B. vulgatus strains showed different effects on the assessed parameters of the mice; particularly, only the administration of B. vulgatus FTJS7K1 was able to protect the architectural integrity of the intestinal epithelium. B. vulgatus FTJS7K1 also negated the LPS-induced changes in cytokine mRNA expression in the colon tissues, and in the proportion of regulatory T cells in the mesenteric lymph node. Compared with the LPS group, the B. vulgatus FTJS7K1 group showed significantly increased abundance of Lactobacillus, Akkermansia, and Bifidobacterium, and decreased abundance of Faecalibaculum. The B. vulgatus FTJS7K1 group also showed significantly increased concentration of SCFAs in fecal samples. The results of genomic analysis showed that these protective roles of B. vulgatus FTJS7K1 may be mediated through specific genes associated with defense mechanisms and metabolism (e.g., the secretion of SCFAs). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the protective role of B. vulgatus FTJS7K1 appear to be via modulation of cytokine production in the colon tissue and regulation of the structure of the gut microbiota. These results provide support for the screening of the Bacteroides genus for next-generation probiotics. © 2021",1.0

In this study, a probiotic mixture, BIO-THREE, was used to alleviate intestinal damage caused by oxaliplatin in mice and human patients. Kunming mice were injected with 15 mg/kg of oxaliplatin twice, and BIO-THREE tablets were administered to mice for 12 days. Patients with gastric cancer undergoing oxaliplatin treatment took BIO-THREE tablets for 2 weeks. The changes in the composition of fecal microbiota both in patients and mice were analyzed using 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing. In mice, oxaliplatin caused a drop in body weight and produced lesions in the liver and small intestines. Probiotic therapy successfully mitigated the damage caused by oxaliplatin to the intestinal tract, but it was not very effective for the liver damage and weight loss caused by oxaliplatin. The sequencing of the gut microflora indicated that oxaliplatin treatment increased the abundance of Bacteroidetes and decreased the abundance of Prevotella in mice. After taking probiotics, the feces of mice and human patients both had a higher abundance of Plovitella and a lower abundance of Bacteroides. The increase in Bacteroidetes and decrease in Prevotella in the gut community might be associated with oxaliplatin-induced intestinal damage. Probiotics appeared to be beneficial, decreasing intestinal damage by restoring the abundance of Bacteroidetes and Prevotella. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",4.0

Accumulating evidence is focused on the roles of gut microbial community in cardiovascular disease, but few studies have unveiled the alterations and further directions of gut microbiota in severe CHF patients. Aimed to investigate this deficiency, fecal samples from 29 CHF patients diagnosed with NYHA Class III-IV and 30 healthy controls were collected and then analyzed using bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing. As a result, there were many significant differences between the two groups. Firstly, the phylum Firmicutes was found to be remarkably decreased in severe CHF patients, and the phylum Proteobacteria was the second most abundant phyla in severe CHF patients instead of phylum Bacteroides strangely. Secondly, the α diversity indices such as chao1, PD-whole-tree and Shannon indices were significantly decreased in the severe CHF versus the control group, as well as the notable difference in β-diversity between the two groups. Thirdly, our result revealed a remarkable decrease in the abundance of the short-chain fatty acids (SCFA)-producing bacteria including genera Ruminococcaceae UCG-004, Ruminococcaceae UCG-002, Lachnospiraceae FCS020 group, Dialister and the increased abundance of the genera in Enterococcus and Enterococcaceae with an increased production of lactic acid. Finally, the alternation of the gut microbiota was presumably associated with the function including Cell cycle control, cell division, chromosome partitioning, Amino acid transport and metabolism and Carbohydrate transport and metabolism through SCFA pathway. Our findings provide the direction and theoretical knowledge for the regulation of gut flora in the treatment of severe CHF. Copyright © 2022 Sun, Du, Fu, Han, Li and Ju.",

Beneficial probiotics are used to modulate gut microbiota. However, factors that mediate host-microbe interactions remain unclear. We evaluated the effects of a combination of multispecies probiotics (MSP) on growth, intestinal epithelial development, intestinal immune function and microbiota of neonatal calves infected with E. coli K99. Twelve newborn calves were randomly assigned as follows: C (control, without MSP); D (E. coli O78:K99 + gentamycin); and P (E. coli O78:K99 + supplemental MSP). All groups were studied for 21 d. MSP supplementation significantly (i) changed fungal Chao1 and Shannon indices of the intestine compared with group D; (ii) reduced the relative abundance of Bacteroides and Actinobacteria, while increasing Bifidobacteria, Ascomycetes, and Saccharomyces, compared with groups C and D; (iii) improved duodenal and jejunal mucosal SIgA and total Short Chain Fatty Acids (SCFA) concentrations compared with group D; (iv) increased relative ZO-1 and occludin mRNA expression in jejunal mucosa compared with group D; and (v) enhanced intestinal energy metabolism and defense mechanisms of calves by reducing HSP90 expression in E. coli K99, thereby alleviating the inflammatory response and promoting recovery of mucosal function.

This study aims to evaluate the anti-viral efficacy of B. dorei. Methods: C57BL/6J mice were infected with influenza virus together with treatment of PBS vehicle, B. dorei, or oseltamivir respectively. Anti-influenza potency of B. dorei and the underlying mechanism were determined by measuring survival rate, lung viral load and pathology, gene expression and production of cytokines and chemokines, and analysis of gut microbiota. Results: Administration of B. dorei increased (by 30%) the survival of influenza-infected mice, and improved their weight loss, lung pathology, lung index, and colon length compared to the vehicle control group. B. dorei treatment reduced (by 61%) the viral load of lung tissue and increased expression of type 1 interferon more rapidly at day 3 postinfection. At day 7 postinfection, B. dorei-treated mice showed lower local (lung) and systemic (serum) levels of interferon and several proinflammatory cytokines or chemokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-10, MCP-1 and IP-10) with a efficacy comparable to oseltamivi treatment. B. dorei treatment also altered gut microbiota as indicated by increased levels of Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Lactobacillus and decreased levels of Escherichia, Shigella, and Parabacteroides. Conclusion: B. dorei has anti-influenza effect. Its working mechanisms involve promoting earlier interferon expression and down-regulating both local and systemic inflammatory response. B. dorei changes the composition of gut microbiota, which may also contribute to its beneficial effects. Copyright © 2022 Song, Huang, Liu, Li, Xiao, Liu, Zhang, Li, Xu, Lu and Ren.",

In this study, we compare the anti-inflammatory effects of six Bacteroides fragilis strains on systemic inflammation and link their strain-specific characteristics, both physiologically and genetically, to their function. A lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced systemic inflammation model in mice was used as an in vivo model to compare the effects of different B. fragilis strains. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The in vitro immunomodulatory properties were evaluated in LPS-stimulating RAW264.7 cell lines. Orthologous gene clusters were compared using OrthoVenn2. The results indicate a strain-specific in vitro anti-inflammatory effect. Effective strains induce higher colon SCFAs in vivo and interleukin-10 (IL-10) production in vitro. Comparative genomic analysis showed that the SCFA-inducing strains possess three genes relating to carbohydrate metabolism (GH2, GH35 families) and binding and transportation (SusD), all of which are associated with niche fitness and expansion. IL-10-inducing strains share a highly similar gene, wbjE, which may result in a distinct O-antigen structure of LPS and influence their immunomodulatory properties. B. fragilis is strain-specific against LPS-induced systemic inflammation in mice. The beneficial effects of a specific strain may be attributed to its SCFA and IL-10 inducing abilities. Strain-specific potential genes can be excavated to link these differences. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",

Both CFBTPS and FBTPS-3 exhibited intestinal anti-inflammatory activities, including restoring body weight, colon length and solid fecal weight, and decreasing the disease activity index score in mice. Moreover, the expression of lipocalin-2 in colitis could be significantly reduced. The inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1β, IFN-γ and TNF-α) and lipopolysaccharides in the serum and the expression of inflammation-related mRNA in the colon tissue were decreased. Both CFBTPS and FBTPS-3 could increase tight junction proteins (Occludin, Claudin-1 and ZO-1), promoting the intestinal barrier function. For gut microbiota, DSS treatment resulted in abnormal proliferation of Bifidobacteria, while FBTPS-3 could restore this disorder to a certain extent. In addition, FBPTS-3 promoted the growth of probiotics such as Bacteroides, Parasutterella and Collinsella.

Increasing evidences demonstrate that environmental stress can lead to the dysbiosis of intestinal microflora, which increases the susceptibility of host to pathogens. Ocean acidification (OA) is one of the greatest environmental threats for marine mollusks with the negative effects on growth and calcification, but its impact on intestinal microflora is poorly understood. In the present study, the intestinal microflora of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas reared at seawater with pH values of 8.1 (control group), 7.8 (AC78 group) and 7.4 (AC74 group) were characterized and compared using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The composition of oyster intestinal microflora changed significantly after acidification, while no significant difference of α-diversity was observed between the control and acidification groups. At the phylum level, the relative abundance of Firmicutes decreased in acidification groups, and the Firmicutes/Bacteroides ratio in AC78 and AC74 groups were 0.53 and 0.31-fold of that in the control group, respectively. At the genus level, the intestinal microflora was dominated by Mycoplasma, which was significantly enriched in the two acidification groups. LEfSe analysis showed that Mycoplasma was one of the most discriminative biomarkers in the AC78 group, while Alteromonadales, Amphritea, Salinirepens and Alteromonas were the biomarker taxa in the AC74 group. The functional prediction results indicated that the pathways related to protein and nucleic acid synthesis were enriched in the two acidification groups, while those related to carbohydrate catabolism were blocked in the AC78 group but enhanced in the AC74 group. These results suggested that the relative abundance of probiotic bacteria decreased upon ocean acidification, which favored the proliferation of pathogenic species in the intestine of oysters. The increased consumption of nutrients caused by microflora proliferation would aggravate the susceptibility of oysters to pathogens. Under greater OA stress, the intestinal microflora would enhance the competition for energy source with their hosts, consequently posing a great challenge to the host health. The information contributed to the better understanding of the oyster-microflora interactions under environmental stress. © 2021",

In the present study, the effects of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum AR113 on the liver regeneration were investigated in 70% partial hepatectomy (PHx) rats. Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were gavaged with L. plantarum AR113 suspensions (1 × 1010 CFU/mL) both before and after partial hepatectomy. The results showed that L. plantarum AR113 administration 2 weeks before partial hepatectomy can accelerate liver regeneration by increased hepatocyte proliferation and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) expression. Probiotic administration enriched Lactobacillus and Bacteroides and depleted Flavonifractor and Acetatifactor in the gut microbiome. Meanwhile, L. plantarum AR113 showed decline of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidyl serine (PS), and lysophosphatidyl choline (LysoPC) levels in the serum of the rats after the L. plantarum AR113 administration. Moreover, L. plantarum AR113 treated rats exhibited higher concentrations of L-leucine, L-isoleucine, mevalonic acid, and lower 7-oxo-8-amino-nonanoic acid in plasma than that in PHx. Spearman correlation analysis revealed a significant correlation between changes in gut microbiota composition and glycerophospholipid. These results indicate that L. plantarum AR113 is promising for accelerating liver regeneration and provide new insights regarding the correlations among the microbiome, the metabolome, and liver regeneration.

This study aimed to confirm the effects of BB-12 on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced gut microbiota disorders. The probiotic BB-12 was consumed by human microbiota-associated rats and changes in gut microbiota were compared using next generation sequencing of the fecal samples collected from the normal chow group, the HFD group, and the BB-12-supplemented group. The enterotypes switched from Prevotella dominant to Akkermansia dominant as a result of switching diet from normal chow to HFD. BB-12 conferred protection on the gut microbiota composition of the rats by increasing the abundance of Prevotella and decreasing the abundance of Clostridium, Blautia, and Bacteroides in 0–3 weeks. In addition, Prevotella-dominant enterotype was maintained, which provides improve obesity effects. A decrease in body weight and the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio were also observed at week 3. While in 4–8 weeks, the enrichment of short-chain fatty acids-producing bacteria such as Eubacterium and Parabacteroides and probiotics such as Bifidobacterium was observed. The results revealed that BB-12 against obesity by regulating gut microbiota in two phases. After a short-term intervention, BB-12 supplementation suppressed the transition from the healthy to obesity state by protecting Prevotella-dominant enterotype, whereas after a long-term intervention, BB-12 ameliorates obesity by enriching beneficial bacteria in the gut.

A microbiome “imbalance” or dysbiosis in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is linked to inflammation. Here, we aim to define the impact of specific foods on bacterial species commonly depleted in patients with IBD to better inform dietary treatment. We performed a single-arm, pre-post intervention trial. After a baseline period, a dietary intervention with the IBD-Anti-Inflammatory Diet (IBD-AID) was initiated. We collected stool and blood samples and assessed dietary intake throughout the study. We applied advanced computational approaches to define and model complex interactions between the foods reported and the microbiome. A dense dataset comprising 553 dietary records and 340 stool samples was obtained from 22 participants. Consumption of prebiotics, probiotics, and beneficial foods correlated with increased abundance of Clostridia and Bacteroides, commonly depleted in IBD cohorts. We further show that specific foods categorized as prebiotics or adverse foods are correlated to levels of cytokines in serum (i.e., GM-CSF, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-alpha) that play a central role in IBD pathogenesis. By using robust predictive analytics, this study represents the first steps to detangle diet-microbiome and diet-immune interactions to inform personalized nutrition for patients suffering from dysbiosis-related IBD. © 2022 The Author(s).

The first group was fed with a high-fat diet, and the second group was fed with a high-fat diet supplemented with the FRB for 8 weeks. FRB supplementation suppressed the high-fat-induced weight gain and considerable alterations in the intestinal microbiota profile in the second group. Among 27 bacterial genera detected in the FRB, only Enterococcus, Lactobacillus, Bacteroides, Prevotella, and the unclassified family Peptostreptococcaceae were detected in mice feces. Their abundances were not particularly increased by FRB supplementation. The abundances of Enterococcus and the unclassified family Peptostreptococcaceae were even suppressed in the second group, suggesting that FRB supplementation didn’t cause an addition of beneficial microbiome but inhibit the proliferation of specific bacteria. Fecal succinic acid concentration was significantly decreased in the second group and highly correlated with the relative abundances of Turicibacter, Enterococcus, and the unclassified family Peptostreptococcaceae. A significant increase in fumaric acid and a decrease in xylitol, sorbitol, uracil, glutamic acid, and malic acid levels were observed in the peripheral blood of the second group.

However, the effect of (R)-sal on repeated dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced chronic colitis has not yet been investigated. In this study evaluated the potential effect of (R)-, (S)-, and (RS)-sal in mice with repeated DSS-induced chronic colitis and investigated the underlying mechanisms. Here, we verified that chronic colitis was significantly attenuated by (R)-sal, which was evidenced by notably mitigated body weight loss, disease activity index (DAI), splenomegaly, colonic lengths shortening, and histopathological scores. (R)-sal treatment noticeably diminished the levels of inflammatory cytokines (such as TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and IFN-γ). Notably, the efficacy of (R)-sal was better than that of (RS)-sal. Further research revealed that (R)-sal mitigated colonic CD4 leukocyte infiltration, decreased NF-κB signaling pathway activation, improved the Nrf-2/HO-1 signaling pathway, and increased the expression of ZO-1 and occludin. In addition, (R)-sal suppressed the levels of TGF-β1, α-SMA, and collagen in mice with chronic colitis. Furthermore, the 16S rDNA sequences analyzed of the intestinal microbiome revealed that (R)-sal could mitigate the intestinal microbiome structure and made it more similar to the control group, which mainly by relieving the relative abundance of pathogens (such as Bacteroides) and increasing the relative abundance of probiotics (such as Akkermansia). Therefore, (R)-sal ameliorates repeated DSS-induced chronic colitis in mice by improving inflammation, suppressing oxidative stress, mitigating intestinal barrier function, relieving intestinal fibrosis, and regulating the intestinal microbiome community. These results indicate that (R)-sal maybe a novel treatment alternative for chronic colitis. © 2022 Liangjun Deng et al.",

Emerging reports (primarily based on reference strain/ATCC-8503) concerningly propose that long-known opportunistic pathogen Pdis is a probiotic. We posit there is an urgent need to characterize the pathogenicity of Pdis strain-strain variability. Unfortunately, no methods/insights exist to classify Bacteroidetes for this purpose. Herein, we developed a virulence gene-based classification system for Pdis and Bacteroidetes to facilitate pathogenic-vs-probiotic characterization. We used DNA in silico methods to develop a system based on the virulence (lipopolysaccharide/bacterial wall) ‘rfbA O-antigen-synthesis gene’. We then performed phylogenetic analysis of rfbA from fourteen Pdis complete genomes (21 genes), other Parabacteroides, Bacteroidetes, and Enterobacteriaceae; and proposed a PCR-based Restriction-Fragment Length Polymorphism method. Cluster analysis revealed that Pdis can be classified into four lineages (based on gene gaps/insertions) which we designated rfbA-Types I, II, III, and IV. In context, we found 14 additional rfbA-types (I–XVIII) interspersed with numerous Bacteroidetes and pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae forming three major “rfbA-superclusters.” For laboratory rfbA-Typing implementation, we developed a PCR-primer strategy to amplify Pdis rfbA genes (100%-specificity) to conduct MboII-RFLP and sub-classify Pdis. In-silico primers for other Bacteroidetes are proposed/discussed. Comparative analysis of lipopolysaccharide/lipid-A gene lpxK confirmed rfbA as highly discriminant. In conclusion, rfbA-Typing classifies Bacteroidetes/Pdis into unique clusters/superclusters given rfbA copy/sequence variability. Analysis revealed that most pathogenic Pdis strains are single-copy rfbA-Type I. The relevance of the rfbA strain variability in disease might depend on their hypothetical modulatory interactions with other O-antigens/lipopolysaccharides and TLR4 lipopolysaccharide-receptors in human/animal cells. © 2021 The Author(s).

AD patients first suffer memory loss for recent events (short-term memory impairment). As the disease progresses, they are deprived of self-awareness. This study aims to explore the effects of a probiotic-supplemented diet on the cognitive behaviors and pathological features of mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Mice in the control group and the 3xTg-AD group were fed a regular diet and a probiotic-supplemented diet, respectively, for 20 weeks. Behavioral experiments like Morris's water maze and Y maze were conducted. Then, feces of mice were collected for 16S sRNA gene sequencing for microorganisms. In the end, soluble and insoluble Aβ40 and Aβ42 in the hippocampus and cortex of mice in each group were quantitatively analyzed with a double-antibody Sandwich ELISA. The expression levels of tau protein and gliocyte in the hippocampus and cortex were detected using the Western Blot method. The result of the Morris water maze experiment indicated that, in the place navigation test, the mice in the 3xTg-AD group experienced a significant decline in the learning ability and a longer escape latency and in the space exploration test, the swimming time of mice in the 3xTg-AD group in the target quadrant decreased and after being treated with the probiotic diet, mice in the 3xTg-AD group had improved learning and memory ability. The result of Y maze showed that the probiotic diet can improve the spontaneous alternation accuracy of mice in the 3xTg-AD group. The result of 16s rRNA gene sequencing showed that, compared with mice in the WT group, those in the 3xTg-AD group experienced a change in the intestinal flora. The Western Blot result displayed a decreased expression level of tau (pS202) (P<0.05) and decreased expression levels of Iba-1 and GFAP (P<0.05). The result of the ELISA experiment showed decreased levels of soluble and insoluble Aβ40 and Aβ42 in 3xTg-AD mice (P<0.05).

No hospitalizations or deaths occurred during the study, precluding the assessment of remaining co-primary outcomes. Probiotic supplementation was well-tolerated and reduced nasopharyngeal viral load, lung infiltrates and duration of both digestive and non-digestive symptoms, compared to placebo. No significant compositional changes were detected in fecal microbiota between probiotic and placebo, but probiotic supplementation significantly increased specific IgM and IgG against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) compared to placebo.

The impact of these policies on the evolution of antimicrobial resistance remains uncertain. In this work, we review the possible limits of such policies and focus on the need for a more efficient approach. Establishing a causal relationship between the introduction of new antibiotics and the emergence of new resistance mechanisms is difficult. Several studies have demonstrated that many resistance mechanisms existed before the discovery of antibiotics. Overcon-sumption of antibiotics has worsened the phenomenon of resistance. Antibiotics are responsible for intestinal dysbiosis, which is suspected of being the source of bacterial resistance. The complexity of the intestinal microbiota composition, the impact of the pharmacokinetic properties of antibiotics, and the multiplicity of other factors involved in the acquisition and emergence of multidrug-resistant organisms, lead us to think that de-escalation, in the absence of studies proving its effectiveness, is not the solution to limiting the spread of multidrug-resistant organisms. More studies are needed to clarify the ecological risk caused by different antibiotic classes. In the meantime, we need to concentrate our efforts on limiting antibiotic prescriptions to patients who really need it, and work on reducing the duration of these treatments. © 2022 by the authors.

The prebiotic activity of SPO-1 on the growth of Lactobacillus paracasei and Bifidobacterium animalis, and its effect on human gut microbiota were examined in vitro. The molecular weight of the tetrasaccharide SPO-1 was 650.2 Da, and it was mainly composed of glucose with α-type glycosidic linkages. The prebiotic activity score of SPO-1 was the highest for the growth of probiotic strains L. paracasei and B. animalis. Furthermore, as fermentation proceeded, SPO-1 was gradually degraded and utilized by intestinal bacteria. The results showed that after treatment with SPO-1, carbohydrate consumption and short-chain fatty acids levels were increased, especially those of i-butyric and i-valeric acids. Moreover, SPO-1 significantly promoted the abundance, diversity and composition of gut microbiota, especially stimulating the growth of Bacteroides, Escherichia-Shigella and Megamonas. In addition, the change in intestinal microbiota function predicted by phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states (PICRUSt) after treatment with SPO-1 is mainly related to the terms “carbohydrate metabolism” and “amino acid metabolism”. These results suggest that SPO-1 is a potential oligosaccharide in regulation of intestinal microbiota. © 2021",1.0

Therefore, its value-added utilization is of prime importance for transforming and upgrading traditional industry. This study aims to utilize SW as a substrate for the growth of probiotics and produce a SW based synbiotics. By a series of trials, the effect of the dietary supplementation with this fermented SW (FSW) was analyzed on ICR mice's body weight, metabolites, and intestinal microbiota in 4 weeks. The results showed that, when SW was concentrated 15 times, the count of viable Lactobacillus casei reached 3.4 × 109 CFU/mL by liquid fermentation method, which was the highest viable cell count among all test strains. In this FSW, the protein, amino acid, total dietary fibre, soluble dietary fibre, and oligosaccharide were 2.10%, 1.63%, 0.52%, 0.51% and 0.79%, respectively. Compared to two control group, the total yields of the short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were significantly improved (75%–125% at average), while the SCFAs structure was also significantly changed (especially acetic acid and butyrate) in the faeces of mice fed FSW. Meanwhile, FSW dietary addition was associated with the diversity and richness of the intestinal microbiota. Obviously, with mice's body weight loss, Firmicutes/Bacteroides ratio reduced accordingly (&lt; 1.21), and the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila was significantly increased (the maximum amount was about 0.013%).

Here, we hypothesized that combining rapidly and slowly fermentable fibers will enhance distal colonic acetate production and improve metabolic health. In vitro cultivation studies in a validated model of the colon were used to identify fiber mixtures that yielded high distal colonic acetate production. Subsequently, in two randomized crossover studies, lean and prediabetic overweight/obese men were included. In one study, participants received supplements of either long-chain inulin+resistant starch (INU+RS), INU or maltodextrin (PLA) the day prior to a clinical investigation day (CID). The second trial studied beta glucan+RS (BG+RS) versus BG and PLA. During each CID, breath hydrogen, indirect calorimetry, plasma metabolites/hormones were assessed during fasting and postprandial conditions. Additionally, fecal microbiota composition and SCFA were determined. In prediabetic men, INU+RS increased plasma acetate compared to INU or PLA (P < .05), but did not affect metabolic parameters. In lean men, INU+RS increased breath hydrogen and fasting plasma butyrate, which was accompanied by increased energy expenditure, carbohydrate oxidation and PYY and decreased postprandial glucose concentrations (all P < .05) compared to PLA. BG+RS increased plasma butyrate compared to PLA (P < .05) in prediabetic individuals, but did not affect other fermentation/metabolic markers in both phenotypes. Fiber-induced shifts in fecal microbiota were individual-specific and more pronounced with INU+RS versus BG+RS. Administration of INU+RS (not BG+RS) the day prior to investigation improved metabolic parameters in lean but not in prediabetic individuals, demonstrating that effects were phenotype- and fiber-specific. Further research should study whether longer-term supplementation periods are required to elicit beneficial metabolic health in prediabetic individuals.

This randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluated the short-term efficacy of systemic probiotics adjunctive to subgingival instrumentation (SI) in promoting a better restoration of the oral-gut microbiotas and greater periodontal clinical outcome. Methods: Systemically healthy adults with untreated periodontitis were recruited from a Dental School setting and allocated to receive SI plus placebo (n = 24) or probiotics (n = 24), one capsule/day for 30 days. Subgingival biofilm and stool were obtained at baseline and 2-months post-therapy for microbiological analyses by checkerboard and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Differences in all parameters between placebo (n = 23) and probiotics (n = 19) groups were assessed by non-parametric tests. Results: Most subgingival species and α-diversity decreased after therapies (P <0.05), whereas gut composition/diversity were slightly or not affected by treatments. In parallel, significant clinical improvement (P <0.05) was similar between groups, although a trend for a higher proportion of poor responders in the placebo (60.8%) than the probiotic group (31.5%) was observed (P = 0.07).

In this study, we used the PolyFermS model to mimic the conditions of the chicken cecum and evaluated three nutritive media for in vitro modeling of the chicken cecal microbiota ecology and metabolism. We observed that our model inoculated with immobilized cecal microbiota and fed with a modified Viande Levure medium (mVL-3) reached a high bacterial cell density of up to approximately 10.5 log cells per mL and stable microbiota composition, akin to the host, during 82 days of continuous operation. Relevant bacterial functional groups containing primary fibrolytic (Bacteroides, Bifidobacteriaceae, Ruminococcaceae), glycolytic (Enterococcus), mucolytic (Bacteroides), proteolytic (Bacteroides), and secondary acetate-utilizing butyrate-producing and propionate-producing (Lachnospiraceae) taxa were preserved in vitro. Besides, conserved metabolic and functional Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways were observed between in vitro microbiota and cecal inoculum microbiota as predicted by functional metagenomics analysis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the continuous inoculation provided by the inoculum reactor generated reproducible metabolic profiles in second-stage reactors comparable to the chicken cecum, allowing for the simultaneous investigation and direct comparison of different treatments with a control. In conclusion, we showed that PolyFermS is a suitable model for mimicking chicken cecal microbiota fermentation allowing ethical and ex vivo screening of environmental factors, such as dietary additives, on chicken cecal fermentation. We report here for the first time a fermentation medium (mVL-3) that closely mimics the substrate conditions in the chicken cecum and supports the growth and metabolic activity of the cecal bacterial akin to the host.

Therefore, we hypothesized that the efficacy of ICB therapy like anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) treatment required an intact host gut microbiota, and it was established that probiotics could enhance the recovery of gut microbiota disruption by external stimuli. Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate the effect of the probiotics, Lactobacillus rhamnosus Probio-M9, on recovering antibiotic-disrupted gut microbiota and its impact on the outcome of ICB therapy in tumor-bearing mice. We first disrupted the mouse microbiota by antibiotics and then remediated the gut microbiota by probiotics or naturally. Tumor transplantation was then performed, followed by anti-PD-1-based antitumor therapy. Changes in the fecal metagenomes and the tumor suppression effect were monitored during different stages of the experiment. Our results showed that Probio-M9 synergized with ICB therapy, significantly improving tumor inhibition compared with groups not receiving the probiotic treatment (P < 0.05 at most time points). The synergistic effect was accompanied by effective restoration of antibiotic-disrupted fecal microbiome that was characterized by a drastically reduced Shannon diversity value and shifted composition of dominating taxa. Moreover, probiotic administration significantly increased the relative abundance of beneficial bacteria (e.g., Bifidobacterium pseudolongum, Parabacteroides distasonis, and some Bacteroides species; 0.0001 < P < 0.05). The gut microbiome changes were accompanied by mild reshaping of the functional metagenomes characterized by enrichment in sugar degradation and vitamin and amino acid synthesis pathways. Collectively, this study supported that probiotic administration could enhance the efficacy and responsiveness of anti-PD-1-based immunotherapy, and Probio-M9 could be a potential candidate of microbe-based synergistic tumor therapeutics. The preclinical data obtained here would support the design of future human clinical trials for further consolidating the current findings and for safety assessment of probiotic adjunctive treatment in ICB therapy.

However, dietary NSPases and Bacillus alone and in combination could significantly decrease the content of Bacteroides in the ileum (P < 0.05). According to Spearman correlation analysis, 7 ilea bacterial microbiomes (S24-7 group, Lactobacillus, Subgroup 2, Subgroup 1, Kitasatospora, Candidatus Solibacter, and Akkermansia) were positively correlated with SOD (P < 0.05). In conclusion, Bacillus (25 mg/kg) and NSPases (150 mg/kg) included in the diet could efficiently enhance the growth performance by altered gut microbiota composition at the genera level and antioxidant indices of ducks.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from probiotics have emerged as potential mediators of host immune response and anti-inflammatory effect. However, the anti-inflammatory effect and mechanism of probiotics derived EVs on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remains unclear. In this study, the effect of Lactobacillus plantarum Q7-derived extracellular vesicles (Q7-EVs) on gut microbiota and intestinal inflammation was investigated in C57BL/6J mice. The results showed that Q7-EVs alleviated DSS-induced colitis symptoms, including colon shortening, bleeding, and body weight loss. Consumption of Q7-EVs reduced the degree of histological damage. DSS-upregulated proinflammatory cytokine levels including IL-6, IL-1β, IL-2 and TNF-α were reduced significantly by Q7-EVs (p < 0.05). 16S rRNA sequencing results showed that Q7-EVs improved the dysregulation of gut microbiota and promoted the diversity of gut microbiota. It was observed that the pro-inflammatory bacteria (Proteobacteria) were reduced and the anti-inflammatory bacteria (Bifidobacteria and Muribaculaceae) were increased. These findings indicated that Q7-EVs might alleviate DSS-induced ulcerative colitis by regulating the gut microbiota.

One of its side-effects is weight gain, which increases the all-cause mortality rate. Considering gut microbiota is one important factor for weight regulation, we hypothesized that probiotics could be potentially used to reduce the docetaxel-related weight gain in breast cancer patients. Methods: From 10/8/2018 to 10/17/2019, 100 breast cancer (Stage I-III) patients underwent four cycles of docetaxel-based chemotherapy were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive probiotics (Bifidobacterium longum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Enterococcus faecalis) or placebo (supplementary material of the probiotics capsule) treatment for 84 days with three capsules per time, twice/day. The primary outcome: the changes in body weight and body-fat percentage of the patients were measured by a designated physician using a fat analyzer, and the secondary outcomes: the fasting insulin, plasma glucose, and lipids were directly obtained from the Hospital Information System (HIS); The metabolites were measured using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS); The fecal microbiome was analyzed using bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequence. All indicators were measured 1 day before the first cycle of docetaxel-based chemotherapy and 21 days after the last cycle of docetaxel-based chemotherapy. Results: Compared with the placebo group, the probiotic group showed significantly smaller changes in body weight (Mean [SD] 0.77 [2.58] vs. 2.70 [3.08], P = 0.03), body-fat percentage (Mean [SD] 0.04 [1.14] vs. 3.86 [11.09], P = 0.02), and low density lipoprotein (LDL) (Mean [SD]−0.05[0.68] vs. 0.39 [0.58], P = 0.002). Moreover, five of the 340 detected plasma metabolites showed significant differences between the two groups. The change of biliverdin dihydrochloride (B = −0.724, P = 0.02) was inverse correlated with weight gain. One strain of the phylum and three strains of the genus were detected to be significantly different between the two groups. Also, the changes of Bacteroides (B = −0.917, P < 0.001) and Anaerostipes (B = −0.894, P < 0.001) were inverse correlated with the change of LDL. Conclusions: Probiotics supplement during docetaxel-based chemotherapy for breast cancer treatment may help to reduce the increase in body weight, body-fat percentage, plasma LDL, and minimize the metabolic changes and gut dysbacteriosis.

It is known to produce antibacterial peptides and has recently received attention for its role as a probiotic strain. Here, we report the isolation of a new strain, Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris RPG-HL-0136 (RPG0136) from dried compost, which exhibits strong antibacterial activity. When RPG0136 was fed to mice, it increased the intestinal population of two beneficial bacteria, Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, whereas it decreased the intestinal population of two harmful bacteria, Bacteroides and Enterobacter. In addition, it increased the concentration of short-chain fatty acids, including acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid, with a simultaneous decrease in pH, and accelerated the catabolic degradation of proteins, lipids, and starch. Lastly, RPG0136 increased the plasma IgG and intestinal mucosal SIgA concentrations and upregulated Reg3r, MUC1, and MUC2 expression to improve the intestinal mucosal immune function. The results of this study suggest that RPG0136 is a potential probiotic strain that supports the growth of a beneficial microbiome by promoting the synthesis of organic acids and enhancing intestinal immune function. © 2021, The Author(s).",

In comparison with placebo, 2 weeks administration of the extract from Thai chili in mice caused loose feces and induced intestinal permeability defect as indicated by FITC-dextran assay and the reduction in tight junction molecules (occludin and zona occludens-1) using fluorescent staining and gene expression by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Additionally, the chili extracts also induced the translocation of gut pathogen molecules; lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and (1!3)-β-D-glucan (BG) and fecal dysbiosis (microbiome analysis), including reduced Firmicutes, increased Bacteroides, and enhanced total Gram-negative bacteria in feces. Both L34 and LGG attenuated gut barrier defect (FITC-dextran, the fluorescent staining and gene expression of tight junction molecules) but not improved fecal consistency. Additionally, high concentrations of capsaicin (0.02–2 mM) damage enterocytes (Caco-2 and HT-29) as indicated by cell viability test, supernatant cytokine (IL-8), transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and transepithelial FITC-dextran (4.4 kDa) but were attenuated by Lactobacillus condition media (LCM) from both probiotic-strains. The 24 h incubation with 2 mM capsaicin (but not the lower concentrations) reduced the abundance of LGG (but not L34) implying a higher capsaicin tolerance of L34. However, Lactobacillus rhamnosus fecal abundance, using qRT-PCR, of L34 or LGG after 3, 7, and 20 days of the administration in the Thai healthy volunteers demonstrated the similarity between both strains. In conclusion, high dose chili extracts impaired gut permeability and induced gut dysbiosis but were attenuated by probiotics. Despite a better capsaicin tolerance of L34 compared with LGG in vitro, L34 abundance in feces was not different to LGG in the healthy volunteers.

Studies show that some bacteria species in gut microbiota, and the lack of others, may play a key role in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) development. Fecal samples were obtained from three groups of children: 16 healthy, 24 with allergies (ALG), and 33 with ASD (probiotics and non-probiotics users). The analysis was carried out according to the KyberKompakt Pro protocol. We observed a significantly higher level of Klebsiella spp. in the healthy children from the non-probiotics group, considering three groups. In the same group, Bifidobacterium spp. the level was lower in ASD compared to neurotypical individuals. In healthy children who did not use probiotics, strong positive correlations were observed in E. coli and Enterococcus spp. and Bacteroides and Klebsiella spp., and a negative correlation for Akkermansia muciniphila with both Klebsiella spp. and Bacteroides spp. In the ASD group who take probiotics, a strongly negative correlation was observed in Lactobacillus spp., and both Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Akkermansia muciniphila levels. In the ALG group, the strongest, negative correlation was found between Enterococcus spp. and Lactobacillus spp. as in Akkermansia muciniphila and Bifidobacterium spp. The simple commercial test revealed minor differences in the composition of intestinal microorganisms between children with autism spectrum disorders and neurotypical peers. © 2021, The Author(s).",

Circadian rhythms cycle on a near 24 h clock. These encompass a variety of changes in the body ranging from blood hormone levels to metabolism, to the gut microbiota composition and others. The gut microbiota, in return, influences the host stress response and the physiological changes associated with it, which makes it an important determinant of health. Lactobacilli are traditionally consumed for their prophylactic and therapeutic benefits against various diseases, namely, the inflammatory bowel syndrome, and even emerged recently as promising psychobiotics. However, the potential role of lactobacilli in the normalization of circadian rhythms has not been addressed. Results: Two-month-old male rats were randomly divided into three groups and housed under three different light/dark cycles for three months: natural light, constant light and constant darkness. The strain Levilactobacillus brevis 47f was administered to rats at a dose of 0.5 ml per rat for one month and The rats were observed for the following two months. As a result, we identified the biomarkers associated with intake of L. brevis 47f. Changing the light regime for three months depleted the reserves of the main buffer in the cell—reduced glutathione. Intake of L. brevis 47f for 30 days restored cellular reserves of reduced glutathione and promoted redox balance. Our results indicate that the levels of urinary catecholamines correlated with light/dark cycles and were influenced by intake of L. brevis 47f. The gut microbiota of rats was also influenced by these factors. L. brevis 47f intake was associated with an increase in the relative abundance of Faecalibacterium and Roseburia and a decrease in the relative abundance of Prevotella and Bacteroides. Conclusions: The results of this study show that oral administration of L. brevis 47f, for one month, to rats housed under abnormal lightning conditions (constant light or constant darkness) normalized their physiological parameters and promoted the gut microbiome's balance. © 2021, The Author(s).",

Six experimental diets included probiotics added at two different inclusion rates into the feed (250 g/ton; PRO250, or 500 g/ton; PRO500), or in the drinking water (25 g/L; PRO-WS), or as a feed synbiotic (250 g probiotic + 250 g/ton prebiotic; SYN), compared to a negative (NC; without additives) and positive control (PC; with antibiotics) diets. The PRO-WS enhanced feed intake (p < 0.05) and tended to improve average daily gain and final body weight (p = 0.14). Broiler gut morphology in the duodenum including the villus height (p = 0.04), villus width (p = 0.05) and crypt depth (p = 0.02) were improved by PRO500. Firmicutes was the most abundant phylum, followed by Bacteroidetes. Streptococcaceae, Lachnoospiraceae, Peptostreptococcaceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Erysipe-lotrichaceae were the top five most abundant families. Antibiotic inclusion in PC reduced microbial beta-diversity and increased similarity compared to probiotic inclusion (p = 0.05). Probiotic inclusion reduced the relative abundance of Bacteroides fragilis, which is a commonly isolated pathogen and is considered as a marker for antimicrobial resistance. Overall, probiotic supplementation via feed or water may potentially improve the production performance of the broiler chickens, and water-soluble probiotics are potentially more effective. Probiotics, especially when added to water, suggest a promising feed additive to support gut microbial maturation and diversity, and may reduce resistant bacteria in broiler chickens. However, it is suggested that the best route for the administration of probiotics be further examined under commercial conditions to find the most effective and practical application method that yields the most consistent results. © 2021 by the authors.

Since a considerable amount of propionate is produced by intestinal bacteria, interest arose in the attempt to reduce propionate-producing bacteria through a monthly antibiotic treatment of metronidazole. In the present study, we investigated the gut microbiota structure of an infant diagnosed at 4 days of life through Expanded Newborn Screening (NBS) and treated the child following international guidelines with a special low-protein diet, specific medications and strict biochemical monitoring. Microbiota composition was assessed during the first month of life, and the presence of Bacteroides fragilis, known to be associated with propionate production, was effectively decreased by metronidazole treatment. After five antibiotic therapy cycles, at 4 months of age, the infant was supplemented with a daily mixture of three bifidobacterial strains, known not to be propionate producers. The supplementation increased the population of bifidobacteria, with Bifidobacterium breve as the dominating species; Ruminococcus gnavus, an acetate and formate producer, was also identified. Metabarcoding analysis, compared with low coverage whole metagenome sequencing, proved to capture all the microbial biodiversity and could be the elected tool for fast and cost-effective monitoring protocols to be implemented in the follow up of rare metabolic disorders such as PA. Data obtained could be a possible starting point to set up tailored microbiota modification treatment studies in the attempt to improve the quality of life of people affected by propionic acidemia. © 2021 by the authors.

The benefits of probiotics being used in animals are well-documented via evidenced growth performance improvement and positive modulations of gut microbiota (GM). Thus, a combination of effective microorganisms (EM) has been frequently used in animal production, including broilers. However, there are only very limited reports of EM on the growth performance and the modulation in GM of partridge shank broiler chicks. Methods. We attempted to evaluate the effects of a basal diet with the addition of an EM mixture on the growth performance and gut microbiome of the chicks. A total of 100 ten-day-old female partridge shank broiler chicks were randomly divided into two groups of 50 chicks each, of which, one group fed with EM supplementation in the basal diet (designated as EM-treated group), the other group just fed with a basal diet (referred as to non-EM treated group or control group). The body weight, daily feed intake, daily gain, feed conversion ratio and other growth parameters were observed and compared between EM-treated and non-EM-treated chicks, and the gut microbiota was profiled by 16S rRNA-based next generation sequencing (NGS). Results. EM-treated chicks showed significantly increased performances in body weight (BW), average daily gain (ADG) and reduced feed conversion ratio (FCR). Histological observation indicated that dietary supplementation of EM significantly increased the villus heights (VH) and the ratio of villus height to crypt depth (VH/CD), while decreased the CD of jejunum, ilea, and ceca. The results of 16S rRNA-based gut microbiota analyses showed that Firmicutes accounted for the most of the relative abundance (63.24%∼92.63%), followed by Proteobacteria (0.62%∼23.94%), Bacteroidetes (0.80%∼7.85%), Actinobacteria (0.06%∼13.69%) and others in both EM-treated and non-EM-treated broiler chicks. The addition of EM could not alter the alpha diversity of gut microbiota. Compared with the non-EM-treated chicks, the abundances of bad bacteria in the phyla of Firmicutes, Euryarchaeota, and Ruminococcus were dramatically decreased in that of EM-treated chicks, while the abundances of good bacteria in the phyla of Actinobacteria and WPS-2 were significantly increased. Conclusions. The supplementation of EM in feed could improve the growth performance and positively influence the morphological characteristics of the intestine, and ameliorate the community and structure of the intestinal microbiota of partridge shank broiler chicks. © 2021 PeerJ Inc..

In clinical practice, several types of probiotics are used in treating AAD, but minimal research has been done on Bacteroides-based microecologics. Our aim was to evaluate the therapeutic effects of Bacteroidetes uniformis FGDLZ48B1, B. intestinalis FJSWX61K18, Bifidobacterium adolescentis FHNFQ48M5, and B. bifidum FGZ30MM3 and their mixture on AAD in mice. The lincomycin hydrochloride-induced AAD models were gavaged with a single strain or a probiotic mixture for a short period to assess the changes in colonic histopathology and cytokine concentrations, intestinal epithelial permeability and integrity, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and the diversity of intestinal microbiota. Our data indicated that both the sole use of Bacteroides and the combination of Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium beneficially weakened systemic inflammation, increased the recovery rate of tissue structures, increased the concentrations of SCFAs, and restored the gut microbiota. Moreover, the probiotic mixture was more effective than the single strain. Specifically, B. uniformis FGDLZ48B1 combined with the B. adolescentis FHNFQ48M5 group was more effective in alleviating the pathological features of the colon, downregulating the concentrations of interleukin (IL)-6, and upregulating the expression of occludin. In summary, our research suggests that administration of a mixture of B. uniformis FGDLZ48B1 and B. adolescentis FHNFQ48M5 is an effective approach for treating AAD. © 2021 by the authors.

The present study aimed to detect the core bacteria at different taxonomic levels and the common beneficial ones in colostrum by analyzing the bacterial composition in 34 colostrum samples of healthy cows selected from two dairy farms. The results of the further analysis showed that the bacterial composition in the colostrum of the two dairy farms was different, but their four most dominant phyla were the same including Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria. The microbiome of all colostrum samples shared ten core operational taxonomic units (OTUs), 21 core genera, and 34 core families, and most of them had no difference in relative abundance between the two farms. The ten core OTUs did not belong to the identified commensal bacteria and have not been detected by previous study. However, several core genera found in our study were also identified as core genus in a previous study. Some well-known beneficial and pathogenic bacteria including Lactobacillus plantarum, Bacillus subtilis, Acinetobacter lwoffii, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were present in the colostrum of healthy cows. However, none had a correlation with the number of somatic cell count (SCC), but the core genera Nubella and Brevundinimas and the core families Methylobacteriaceae and Caulobacteraceae positively correlated with the number of SCC. The genus Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas, and Chryseobacterium in colostrum had a positive correlation with each other, while the probiotics unidentified-Bacteroidales-S24-7-group had a negative correlation with Pseudomonas and Chryseobacterium. In addition, more than 50% bacterial OTUs in colostrum were detected in the rectal content including some strictly anaerobic bacteria that are generally present in the intestine and rumen. However, of the top 30 commonly shared bacterial genera in the colostrum and rectal feces, no genus in colostrum was positively correlated with that same genus in rectal feces. In conclusion, the bacterial composition of colostrum microbiota is greatly influenced by external factors and individuals. There were several core OTUs, and some core genus and families in the colostrum samples. Colostrum from healthy cows contained both beneficial and pathogenic bacteria and shared many common bacteria with rectal content including some gastrointestinal anaerobes. © 2021 by the authors.

Nine adults were divided into Type P (fecal microbiota dominated by Prevotella, 4 adults) and Type B (fecal microbiota dominated by Bacteroides, 5 adults) based on an enterotype analysis. The responses of variation had been found in two enterotypes. The α-diversity was not changed significantly after the administration of probiotics in both Type P and B. However, the community structure in Type B was substantially influenced. After the administration of probiotics, Weissella and Leuconostoc were significantly higher in Type P, while Collinsella significantly increased in Type B.

However, the underlying host-symbiont molecular interactions contributing to these signatures remain poorly understood. In this study, we address this gap using cheminformatic analyses to elucidate potential gut microbial metabolites that may perturb the longevity-associated NAD+ metabolic network. In silico ADMET, KEGG interaction analysis, molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation, and molecular mechanics calculation predict a large number of safe and bioavailable microbial metabolites to be direct and/or indirect activators of NAD+-dependent sirtuin proteins. Our simulation results suggest dihydropteroate, phenylpyruvic acid, indole-3-propionic acid, phenyllactic acid, all-trans-retinoic acid, and multiple deoxy-, methyl-, and cyclic nucleotides from intestinal microbiota as the best-performing regulators of NAD+ metabolism. Retracing these molecules to their source microorganisms also suggest commensal Escherichia, Bacteroides, Bifidobacteria, and Lactobacilli to be associated with the highest number of pro-longevity metabolites.

This study aimed to investigate the potential CRC ameliorating effect of a multi-strain probiotics mixture on azoxymethane/dextran sulfate sodium-induced CRC mice. After establishing the CRC mouse model, the mice were gavaged with probiotics mixture once daily (∼1 × 109 CFU/mouse) for 8 consecutive weeks. The anti-tumorigenesis effect of probiotics mixture was investigated from the aspects of intestinal microbiota, inflammation, barrier function and oxidative stress. The fecal microbiota was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Results showed that probiotics mixture could significantly inhibit tumorigenesis and inflammatory response. The intestinal barrier function was ameliorated after treatment with this probiotics mixture by recovering the expression of tight junction-related proteins and preventing goblet cell loss. The oxidative stress was alleviated under the increase of antioxidant mediators (total mercapto, reduced glutathione and superoxide dismutase) and the decrease of oxidative mediators (malondialdehyde and myeloperoxidase). In addition, supplementation of probiotics mixture led to an increase of some beneficial bacteria (Lachnospiraceae and Roseburia) and a decrease of some harmful bacteria (Bacteroides and Desulfovibrio), which in turn increased short-chain fatty acids and decreased lipopolysaccharide.

The respective mixtures were then separately evaluated as prebiotics by analysis of their consumption by two phylogenetically different potential probiotic bacterial strains (Bifidobacterium adolescentis ATCC15703 and Weissella cibaria strain 92), from which release of short chain fatty acids (SCFA) was also monitored. The GXOs mixture was produced using a glucuronosyl-requiring family 30 glycoside hydrolase (GH) Bacteroides ovatus (BoXyn30A), while the XOs mixture was produced by a 30 min acid treatment of QSGAX with H2SO4 [24.5 g/L] at 90 °C. B. adolescentis consumed both GXOs and XOs (DP 2–6), in both cases releasing acetate, lactate, propionate, formate and butyrate as metabolic products. W. cibaria only consumed XOs (DP 2–4), releasing acetate, lactate and minor amounts of butyrate. This is the first study reporting the ability of GXOs consumption by B. adolescentis and shows the potential of GXOs to selectively stimulate B. adolescentis, while XOs stimulated both types of potential probiotics (B. adolescentis ATCC15703 and W. cibaria strain 92). © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",1.0

However, S. boulardii has not been studied as a microbial cell factory for producing useful substances. Agarose, a major component of red macroalgae, can be depolymerized into neoagarooligosaccharides (NAOSs) by an endo-type β-agarase. NAOSs, including neoagarotetraose (NeoDP4), are known to be health-benefiting substances owing to their prebiotic effect. Thus, NAOS production in the gut is required. In this study, the probiotic yeast S. boulardii was engineered to produce NAOSs by expressing an endo-type β-agarase, BpGH16A, derived from a human gut bacterium Bacteroides plebeius. Results: In total, four different signal peptides were compared in S. boulardii for protein (BpGH16A) secretion for the first time. The SED1 signal peptide derived from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was selected as optimal for extracellular production of NeoDP4 from agarose. Expression of BpGH16A was performed in two ways using the plasmid vector system and the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Cas9 system. The production of NeoDP4 by engineered S. boulardii was verified and quantified. NeoDP4 was produced by S. boulardii engineered using the plasmid vector system and CRISPR-Cas9 at 1.86 and 0.80 g/L in a 72-h fermentation, respectively. Conclusions: This is the first report on NAOS production using the probiotic yeast S. boulardii. Our results suggest that S. boulardii can be considered a microbial cell factory to produce health-beneficial substances in the human gut.

However, for most probiotic strains, these in vivo genetic processes are still poorly characterized. Here, we investigated the effects of gut selection pressures from human, mice, and zebrafish on the genetic stability of a candidate probiotic Lactiplantibacillus plantarum HNU082 (Lp082) as well as its ecological and evolutionary impacts on the indigenous gut microbiota using shotgun metagenomic sequencing in combination with isolate resequencing methods. Results: We combined both metagenomics and isolate whole genome sequencing approaches to systematically study the gut-adaptive evolution of probiotic L. plantarum and the ecological and evolutionary changes of resident gut microbiomes in response to probiotic ingestion in multiple host species. Independent of host model, Lp082 colonized and adapted to the gut by acquiring highly consistent single-nucleotide mutations, which primarily modulated carbohydrate utilization and acid tolerance. We cultivated the probiotic mutants and validated that these gut-adapted mutations were genetically stable for at least 3 months and improved their fitness in vitro. In turn, resident gut microbial strains, especially competing strains with Lp082 (e.g., Bacteroides spp. and Bifidobacterium spp.), actively responded to Lp082 engraftment by accumulating 10–70 times more evolutionary changes than usual. Human gut microbiota exhibited a higher ecological and genetic stability than that of mice. Conclusions: Collectively, our results suggest a highly convergent adaptation strategy of Lp082 across three different host environments. In contrast, the evolutionary changes within the resident gut microbes in response to Lp082 were more divergent and host-specific; however, these changes were not associated with any adverse outcomes. This work lays a theoretical foundation for leveraging animal models for ex vivo engineering of probiotics to improve engraftment outcomes in humans.

Bacteria in the intestinal mucosa have better adhesion to the host intestinal epithelial cells compared to bacteria in the intestinal contents. In this study, lactic acid bacteria were isolated from the intestinal mucosa of broiler chickens and investigated as the substitution to antibiotic in broiler production. Results: In addition to acid resistance, high temperature resistance, antimicrobial sensitivity tests, and intestinal epithelial cell adhesion, Enterococcus faecium PNC01 (E. faecium PNC01) was showed to be non-cytotoxic to epithelial cells. Draft genome sequence of E. faecium PNC01 predicted that it synthesized bacteriocin to perform probiotic functions and bacteriocin activity assay showed it inhibited Salmonella typhimurium from invading intestinal epithelial cells. Diet supplemented with E. faecium PNC01 increased the ileal villus height and crypt depth in broiler chickens, reduced the relative length of the cecum at day 21, and reduced the relative length of jejunum and ileum at day 42. Diet supplemented with E. faecium PNC01 increased the relative abundance of Firmicutes and Lactobacillus, decreased the relative abundance of Bacteroides in the cecal microbiota. Conclusion: E. faecium PNC01 replaced antibiotics to reduce the feed conversion rate. Furthermore, E. faecium PNC01 improved intestinal morphology and altered the composition of microbiota in the cecum to reduce feed conversion rate. Thus, it can be used as an alternative for antibiotics in broiler production to avoid the adverse impact of antibiotics by altering the gut microbiota.

Here, we investigated the enzymatic and metabolic cooperation between two human gut symbionts, Bacteroides plebeius and Bifidobacterium longum ssp. infantis, with regard to the degradation of agarose, the main carbohydrate of red seaweed. More specifically, B. plebeius initially decomposed agarose into agarotriose by the actions of the enzymes belonging to glycoside hydrolase (GH) families 16 and 117 (i.e., BpGH16A and BpGH117) located in the polysaccharide utilization locus, a specific gene cluster for red seaweed carbohydrates. Then, B. infantis extracted energy from agarotriose by the actions of two agarolytic β-galactosidases (i.e., Bga42A and Bga2A) and produced neoagarobiose. B. plebeius ultimately acted on neoagarobiose by BpGH117, resulting in the production of 3,6-anhydro-l-galactose, a monomeric sugar possessing anti-inflammatory activity. Our discovery of the cooperative actions of the two human gut symbionts on agarose degradation and the identification of the related enzyme genes and metabolic intermediates generated during the metabolic processes provide a molecular basis for agarose degradation by gut bacteria. © 2021, The Author(s).",1.0

Because of the high similarity in mass spectra between B. dorei and Bacteroides vulgatus, discriminating between these species is arduous in clinical practice. In recent decades, 16S rRNA gene sequencing has been a complementary method for distinguishing taxonomically close bacteria, including B. dorei and B. vulgatus, at the genus and species levels. Consequently, B. dorei has been shown to contribute to some diseases, including type 1 autoimmune diabetes mellitus and atherosclerotic diseases. However, there are no reports on invasive infectious diseases caused by B. dorei. This report describes the first case of direct invasion and colonisation of human tissue by B. dorei, thus providing a warning regarding the previously proposed application of B. dorei as a live biotherapeutic for atherosclerotic diseases. Case presentation: A 78-year-old Japanese man complained of intermittent chest/back pain and was diagnosed with a mycotic thoracic aortic aneurysm by enhanced computed tomography on admission. Despite strict blood pressure control and empirical antibiotic therapy, the patient’s condition worsened. To prevent aneurysmal rupture and eliminate infectious foci, the patient underwent surgical treatment. The resected specimen was subjected to tissue culture and 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis to identify pathogenic bacteria. A few days after the surgery, culture and sequencing results revealed that the pathogen was B. dorei/B. vulgatus and B. dorei, respectively. The patient was successfully treated with appropriate antibacterial therapy and after improvement, was transferred to another hospital for rehabilitation on postoperative day 34. There was no recurrence of infection or aneurysm after the patient transfer. Conclusions: This report describes the first case of invasive infectious disease caused by B. dorei, casting a shadow over its utilisation as a probiotic for atherosclerotic diseases. © 2021, The Author(s).",1.0

Thirty litters of 3-day-old crossbreed piglets were randomly assigned to one of the three treatments, and treatments were commenced on day 3 after birth. During the whole period of the experiment, the piglets were kept with their mothers and left to suckle ad libitum while being supplemented with a milk formula with or without the bacterial probiotic supplemented. The control group (CON) was not treated with probiotics, the HLS group was treated with LS144 (HLS) screened from feces of fast-growing pigs with high body mass index (BMI) while the NLS group was supplemented with LS160 (NLS) screened from feces obtained from pigs of normal BMI. At the weaning time, a higher abundance of Actinobacteria, Lentisphaerae, and Elusimicrobia phyla were observed in NLS piglets, whereas the abundance of Fibrobacteres phylum was significantly reduced in NLS and HLS piglets compared with the CON. A greater abundance of Lactobacillus was detected in the HLS treatment compared with the CON. The abundance of Bacteroides and Fibrobacter was higher in the CON piglets compared with the HLS and NLS piglets. Compared with the CON group, the oral administration of LS significantly increased the number of Lactobacillus and villus height in the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. Moreover, the villus height of the duodenum was significantly improved in the HLS treatment compared with the NLS treatment. Based on the findings in the neonatal piglet model, we suggest that oral supplementation of LS, particularly LS isolated from high BMI pigs, could be beneficial by improving the intestinal villus height. © 2021, The Author(s).",5.0

About 50% of GD patients also have Graves’ orbitopathy (GO), an intractable disease in which expansion of the orbital contents causes diplopia, proptosis and even blindness. Murine models of GD/GO, developed in different centres, demonstrated significant variation in gut microbiota composition which correlated with TSHR-induced disease heterogeneity. To investigate whether correlation indicates causation, we modified the gut microbiota to determine whether it has a role in thyroid autoimmunity. Female BALB/c mice were treated with either vancomycin, probiotic bacteria, human fecal material transfer (hFMT) from patients with severe GO or ddH2O from birth to immunization with TSHR-A subunit or beta-galactosidase (βgal; age ~ 6 weeks). Incidence and severity of GD (TSHR autoantibodies, thyroid histology, thyroxine level) and GO (orbital fat and muscle histology), lymphocyte phenotype, cytokine profile and gut microbiota were analysed at sacrifice (~ 22 weeks). Results: In ddH2O-TSHR mice, 84% had pathological autoantibodies, 67% elevated thyroxine, 77% hyperplastic thyroids and 70% orbital pathology. Firmicutes were increased, and Bacteroidetes reduced relative to ddH2O-βgal; CCL5 was increased. The random forest algorithm at the genus level predicted vancomycin treatment with 100% accuracy but 74% and 70% for hFMT and probiotic, respectively. Vancomycin significantly reduced gut microbiota richness and diversity compared with all other groups; the incidence and severity of both GD and GO also decreased; reduced orbital pathology correlated positively with Akkermansia spp. whilst IL-4 levels increased. Mice receiving hFMT initially inherited their GO donors’ microbiota, and the severity of induced GD increased, as did the orbital brown adipose tissue volume in TSHR mice. Furthermore, genus Bacteroides, which is reduced in GD patients, was significantly increased by vancomycin but reduced in hFMT-treated mice. Probiotic treatment significantly increased CD25+ Treg cells in orbital draining lymph nodes but exacerbated induced autoimmune hyperthyroidism and GO. Conclusions: These results strongly support a role for the gut microbiota in TSHR-induced disease. Whilst changes to the gut microbiota have a profound effect on quantifiable GD endocrine and immune factors, the impact on GO cellular changes is more nuanced. The findings have translational potential for novel, improved treatments. [MediaObject not available: see fulltext.] © 2021, The Author(s).",6.0

In this study, we determined the impact of GOS diets on hallmarks of gut aging: microbiome dysbiosis, inflammation, and intestinal barrier defects (“leaky gut”). We also evaluated if short-term GOS feeding influenced how the aging gut responded to antibiotic challenges in a mouse model of Clostridioides difficile infection. Finally, we assessed if colonic organoids could reproduce the GOS responder—non-responder phenotypes observed in vivo. Results: Old animals had a distinct microbiome characterized by increased ratios of non-saccharolytic versus saccharolytic bacteria and, correspondingly, a lower abundance of β-galactosidases compared to young animals. GOS reduced the overall diversity, increased the abundance of specific saccharolytic bacteria (species of Bacteroides and Lactobacillus), increased the abundance of β-galactosidases in young and old animals, and increased the non-saccharolytic organisms; however, a robust, homogeneous bifidogenic effect was not observed. GOS reduced age-associated increased intestinal permeability and increased MUC2 expression and mucus thickness in old mice. Clyndamicin reduced the abundance Bifidobacterium while increasing Akkermansia, Clostridium, Coprococcus, Bacillus, Bacteroides, and Ruminococcus in old mice. The antibiotics were more impactful than GOS on modulating serum markers of inflammation. Higher serum levels of IL-17 and IL-6 were observed in control and GOS diets in the antibiotic groups, and within those groups, levels of IL-6 were higher in the GOS groups, regardless of age, and higher in the old compared to young animals in the control diet groups. RTqPCR revealed significantly increased gene expression of TNFα in distal colon tissue of old mice, which was decreased by the GOS diet. Colon transcriptomics analysis of mice fed GOS showed increased expression of genes involved in small-molecule metabolic processes and specifically the respirasome in old animals, which could indicate an increased oxidative metabolism and energetic efficiency. In young mice, GOS induced the expression of binding-related genes. The galectin gene Lgals1, a β-galactosyl-binding lectin that bridges molecules by their sugar moieties and is an important modulator of the immune response, and the PI3K-Akt and ECM-receptor interaction pathways were also induced in young mice. Stools from mice exhibiting variable bifidogenic response to GOS injected into colon organoids in the presence of prebiotics reproduced the response and non-response phenotypes observed in vivo suggesting that the composition and functionality of the microbiota are the main contributors to the phenotype. Conclusions: Dietary GOS modulated homeostasis of the aging gut by promoting changes in microbiome composition and host gene expression, which was translated into decreased intestinal permeability and increased mucus production. Age was a determining factor on how prebiotics impacted the microbiome and expression of intestinal epithelial cells, especially apparent from the induction of galectin-1 in young but not old mice.

By expanding our understanding of metabolic pathways in these ecosystems, we will garner foundational information for manipulating microbiome structure and function to influence host physiology. Currently, our knowledge of metabolic pathways relies heavily on inferences derived from metagenomics or culturing bacteria in vitro. However, novel approaches targeting specific cell physiologies can illuminate the functional potential encoded within microbial (meta)genomes to provide accurate assessments of metabolic abilities. Using fluorescently labeled polysaccharides, we visualized carbohydrate metabolism performed by single bacterial cells in a complex rumen sample, enabling a rapid assessment of their metabolic phenotype. Specifically, we identified bovine-adapted strains of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron that metabolized yeast mannan in the rumen microbiome ex vivo and discerned the mechanistic differences between two distinct carbohydrate foraging behaviors, referred to as “medium grower” and “high grower.” Using comparative whole-genome sequencing, RNA-seq, and carbohydrate-active enzyme fingerprinting, we could elucidate the strain-level variability in carbohydrate utilization systems of the two foraging behaviors to help predict individual strategies of nutrient acquisition. Here, we present a multi-faceted study using complimentary next-generation physiology and “omics” approaches to characterize microbial adaptation to a prebiotic in the rumen ecosystem.

The microbiota has potential to regulate the colonization of pathogens by competitive exclusion, production of antimicrobial compounds, and stimulation of the mucosal immune system. But information on the microbiota in commercial broiler chickens is limited because of the difficulty of conducting studies at commercial farms. To obtain fundamental information that can be used to control pathogens in chickens, we determined the 6-week dynamics of microbiota in chicken cecal droppings from commercial broiler farms. Results: Cecal droppings from four chickens were collected once a week from 1 to 6 weeks of age at three commercial broiler farms. A total of 168 samples were collected from 7 flocks and subjected to 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Despite the farms have distinctly different climate conditions, the microbiota in the same growth stages were similar among farms. Moreover, as the chickens grew and the feed types were switched, the richness and diversity of the microbiota gradually increased and convergence of the composition of the microbiota was apparent. Notably, minor bacterial taxa (i.e. OTUs with relative abundance < 0.05%) within the microbiota were changed by the chicken age, switching of feed types, and presence of Campylobacter. In particular, the effects of switching of feed types on the microbiota were larger than the effects of age and Campylobacter. Conclusions: Irrespective of the locations of the farms, the microbiota of chicken cecum, especially minor bacteria, was successively changed more affected by feed types than by ages. Switching of feed types inducing the alteration of the microbiota may be associated with the colonization of pathogens in the chicken gut. These results will also help with extrapolation of studies in experimental animals to those in the commercial farms. © 2021, The Author(s).",3.0

The etiology is heterogeneous and multifactorial, including genetic susceptibility, immune-mediated tissue damage, and changes of lumen microenvironment, especially short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) producing bacteria. Several studies reported a decrease in SCFA concentration in both CD and UC. In fact, SCFAs has important roles in accelerating disease remission. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the changes in SCFA concentration, the composition of SCFA-producing bacteria, and SCFA metabolism in IBD. A literature search was conducted via PubMed, Scopus, and CENTRAL by selecting studies according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. The quality and risk of bias assessment were performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Overall, 160 UC and 127 CD patients from 5 studies were reviewed. The SCFA concentration was significantly reduced (p <0.05) in both PC and UC. Moreover, there was a decrease in major SCFA-producing bacteria. Clostridium coccoides were significantly decreased in the feces of active UC (p = 0.015) and CD (p = 0.04). Clostridium leptum was decreased on intestinal mucosal biopsy of active CD and UC (p <0.0001). Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were decreased in active CD faeces (p <0.0001) and UC (p = 0.0001). Butyrate oxidation rate was also reported to decrease in UC compared to control (p<0.0001). In conclusion, the ability of major SCFA-producing bacterial production in IBD was diminished, which implies a decreased protective and anti-inflammatory effect of SCFA that altered its metabolism. © RJPT All right reserved.",

Here, we compared the differences in the gut microbiota of male and female healthy controls (HC) and patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) caused by immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy (ESRD-IgAN) or type-2 diabetes mellitus (ESRD-T2DM) using high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. We also analyzed the correlation between gut microbiota and clinical immune indicators. We assigned 8, 10, 5, 7, 11, and 20 volunteers to female HC, ESRD-IgAN, and ESRD-T2DM, and male HC, ESRD-IgAN, and ESRD-T2DM, respectively. The results showed sex-specific differences in both physiological and biochemical indices and intestinal microbiota composition, as well as the correlation between them. The correlations between physiological and biochemical indices in men were significantly lower than those in women, especially for indices related to immunity, blood glucose, and cardiac color sonography. Urine output, lymphocyte ratio, serum albumin, blood calcium, dialysis status, serum urea nitrogen, urine protein, and diabetes significantly correlated with male fecal microbiota composition, whereas only creatinine and 2-h post-prandial blood glucose significantly correlated with female fecal microbiota composition. The top 50 dominant operational taxonomic units showed a stronger correlation with physiological and biochemical indices in samples obtained from females than from males. These differences highlight sex-specific differences in the effectiveness of ESRD prevention and treatments via regulating intestinal microbiota.

In this study, a lactic acid biosynthesis pathway that directly produces lactic acid from glucose rather than ethanol with high production was reconstructed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The engineered S. cerevisiae showed anti-inflammatory activity in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced mice with improved histological damage, increased mucosal barrier, and decreased intestinal immune response. Lactic acid regulated the macrophage polarization state and inhibited the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in vivo and in vitro. Increasing the macrophage monocarboxylic acid transporter-mediated active lactic acid uptake suppressed the excessive activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and the downstream caspase-1 pathway in macrophages. Moreover, lactic acid promoted histone H3K9 acetylation and histone H3K18 lactylation. Meanwhile, the engineered S. cerevisiae altered the diversity and composition of the intestinal microbiota and changed the abundance of metabolic products in mice with colitis.

Sulfated polysaccharide from pacific abalone (AGSP) reduced the level of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and increased the production of short chain fatty acids in the colon of mice, and it reduced the levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and increased the IL-10 level in in vitro cell models, suggesting that it can be used as a probiotic agent to inhibit intestinal inflammation. Furthermore, AGSP reduced the disease activity index and intestinal damage, improved the mucosal immune response, and inhibited oxidative damage in mice with DSS-induced acute and chronic colitis, which can be associated with modulation of the NF-κB signaling pathway and gut microbiota. AGSP regulated the structure of the gut microbiota and reduced the level of Bacteroides that had positive correlation with the colitis symptoms.

We found that the levels of circulating branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) and their cognate α-ketoacids (BCKA) were significantly correlated with the body weight in humans and mice and that BCAA catabolic defects in BAT were associated with obesity in diet-induced obesity (DIO) mice. Pharmacological systemic enhancement of BCAA catabolic activity reduced plasma BCAA and BCKA levels and protected against obesity; these effects were reduced in BATectomized mice. DIO mice gavaged with Bacteroides dorei and Bacteroides vulgatus exhibited improved BAT BCAA catabolism and attenuated body weight gain, which were not observed in BATectomized DIO mice. Our data have highlighted a possible link between the gut microbiota and BAT BCAA catabolism and suggest that Bacteroides probiotics could be used for treating obesity. © 2021 The Author(s)",2.0

In recent years, increasing evidence has demonstrated that probiotics can treat osteoporosis. This study aimed to explore the relevant mechanisms and to validate the beneficial effect on osteoporosis by high-throughput metagenome-wide gene sequencing in humans. In this study, compared with controls, several species had altered abundances, and specific functional pathways were found in the OP group. At the species level, the species that had increased in OP individuals were positively correlated to bone resorption markers and negatively correlated to 25-OH-D3 and bone formation markers, with Streptococcus sanguinis showing the strongest relevance, followed by Streptococcus gordonii, Actinomyces odontolyticus, and Olsenella unclassified. Additionally, Actinomyces graevenitzii, enriched in the OP group, was positively correlated to inflammation indicators that included white blood cell (WBC), neutrophil count (NEC), and the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (p < 0.05). Conversely, the levels of Akkermansia muciniphila, Bacteroides eggerthii, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides uniformis, and Butyricimonas synergistic were increased in the control group, which had a negative correlation with bone resorption markers and positive correlation with bone formation markers and 25-OH-D3. Additionally, Bacteroides fragilis had a negative correlation with inflammation indicators (WBC, NEC, and NLR) and the above pathways (p < 0.05). Functional prediction revealed that 106 metabolic pathways, enriched in the OP group, were significantly higher than in the control group (p < 0.05). In particular, pathways related to LPS biosynthesis, phytate degradation, lactate acid, and ethanol fermentation were more abundant in the OP group than in the control and were positively related to WBC and NEC. Taken together, several species with altered abundances and specific functional pathways were found in OP individuals. The role of phytases in OP provides novel epidemiological evidence to elucidate the underlying microbiota-relevant mechanisms in bone mineralization and should be explored further.

Bacillus subtilis is a nonpathogenic and noninvasive probiotic bacterium for humans and other animals, playing an important role in improving the host immune system’s ability to respond to intestinal and liver diseases and modulating gut microbiota. However, whether B. subtilis can impact biological functions in Schistosoma japonicum–infected mice is unclear. This study used oral administration (OA) of B. subtilis to treat mice infected with S. japonicum. We evaluated changes in the gut microbiota of infected mice using 16 S rRNA gene sequencing and differentially expressed gene profiles using transcriptome sequencing after OA B. subtilis. We found that OA B. subtilis significantly attenuated hepatic and intestinal pathological injuries in infected mice. The gut microbiota of mice were significantly altered after S. japonicum infection, while OA B. subtilis remodel the diversity and composition of gut microbiomes of infected mice. We found that the S. japonicum–infected mice with OA B. subtilis had an overabundance of the most prevalent bacterial genera, including Bacteroides, Enterococcus, Lactobacillus, Blautia, Lachnoclostridium, Ruminiclostridium, and Enterobacter. Transcriptomic analysis of intestinal tissues revealed that OA B. subtilis shaped the intestinal microenvironment of the host responding to S. japonicum infection. Differentially expressed genes were classified into KEGG pathways between S. japonicum–infected mice and those without included cell adhesion molecules, intestinal immune network for IgA production, hematopoietic cell lineage, Fc epsilon RI signaling pathway, Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation, Th17 cell differentiation, calcium signaling pathway, Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis, chemokine signaling pathway, phospholipase D signaling pathway, NF-kappa B signaling pathway, B cell receptor signaling pathway, pancreatic secretion, and phagosome. In conclusion, our findings showed that OA B. subtilis alleviates pathological injuries and regulates gene expression, implying that B. subtilis supplementation may be a potential therapeutic strategy for schistosomiasis. Our study may highlight the value of probiotics as a beneficial supplementary therapy during human schistosomiasis, but further studies are needed.

Totally, four PULs contain ten enzymes and four glycan binding proteins which including a novel surface enzyme and a surface glycan binding protein are identified. Notably, PUL2 and PUL3 have not been reported so far. Further, we show that the degradation products support the growth of other Bacteroides spp. and probiotics.

This study performed 16S rRNA gene-based microbial profiling of 143 subjects. We observed structural and compositional alterations in the gut microbiota of the SARS-CoV-2-infected group in comparison to non-infected controls. The gut microbiota composition of the SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals showed an increase in anti-inflammatory bacteria such as Faecalibacterium (p-value = 1.72 × 10–6) and Bacteroides (p-value = 5.67 × 10–8). We also revealed a higher relative abundance of the highly beneficial butyrate producers such as Anaerostipes (p-value = 1.75 × 10–230), Lachnospiraceae (p-value = 7.14 × 10–65), and Blautia (p-value = 9.22 × 10–18) in the SARS-CoV-2-infected group in comparison to the control group. Moreover, phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstructing unobserved state (PICRUSt) functional prediction analysis of the 16S rRNA gene abundance data showed substantial differences in the enrichment of metabolic pathways such as lipid, amino acid, carbohydrate, and xenobiotic metabolism, in comparison between both groups. We discovered an enrichment of linoleic acid, ether lipid, glycerolipid, and glycerophospholipid metabolism in the SARS-CoV-2-infected group, suggesting a link to SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication in host cells. We estimate the major contributing genera to the four pathways to be Parabacteroides, Streptococcus, Dorea, and Blautia, respectively.

Up to a third of patients with moderate to severe UC require proctocolectomy with ileal pouch ano-anastomosis (IPAA). We aimed to explore the mucosal microbiota of UC patients who underwent IPAA. Methods: For microbiome analysis, mucosal specimens were collected from 34 IPAA individuals. Endoscopic and histological examinations of IPAA were normal in 21 cases, while pouchitis was in 13 patients. 19 specimens from the healthy control (10 from colonic and 9 from ileum) were also analyzed. Data were analyzed using an ensemble of software packages: QIIME2, coda-lasso, clr-lasso, PICRUSt2, and ALDEx2. Results: IPAA specimens had significantly lower bacterial diversity as compared to normal. The microbial composition of the normal pouch was also decreased also when compared to pouchitis. Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Gemmiger formicilis, Blautia obeum, Ruminococcus torques, Dorea formicigenerans, and an unknown species from Roseburia were the most uncommon in pouch/pouchitis, while an unknown species from Enterobacteriaceae was over-represented. Propionibacterium acnes and Enterobacteriaceae were the species most abundant in the pouchitis and in the normal pouch, respectively. Predicted metabolic pathways among the IPAA bacterial communities revealed an important role of immunometabolites such as SCFA, butyrate, and amino acids. Conclusions: Our findings showed specific bacterial signature hallmarks of dysbiosis and could represent bacterial biomarkers in IPAA patients useful to develop novel treatments in the future by modulating the gut microbiota through the administration of probiotic immunometabolites-producing bacterial strains and the addition of specific prebiotics and the faecal microbiota transplantation. © 2021 by the authors.

The potential link between these effects is of interest.0 Objective: The aim for this systematic review was to assess evidence surrounding the influence of cereal fiber intake on microbiome composition, microbiome diversity, short-chain fatty acid production, and risk factors for metabolic syndrome. Data Sources and Extraction: The MEDLINE, PubMed, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library databases were searched systematically, and quality of studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool. Evidence relating to study design, dietary data collection, and outcomes was qualitatively synthesized on the basis of fiber type. Data Analysis: Forty-six primary publications and 2 secondary analyses were included. Cereal fiber modulated the microbiome in most studies; however, taxonomic changes indicated high heterogeneity. Short-chain fatty acid production, microbiome diversity, and metabolic-related outcomes varied and did not always occur in parallel with microbiome changes. Poor dietary data were a further limitation. Conclusions: Cereal fiber may modulate the gut microbiome; however, evidence of the link between this and metabolic outcomes is limited.

Plantarum zdy2013 in alleviating kidney injury induced by high-salt diet,2021,Nutrients,10.3390/nu13113920,"A high-salt diet (HSD) is one of the key risk factors for hypertension and kidney injury. In this study, a HSD C57BL/6J mice model was established with 4% NaCl, and then different concentrations of Lactobacillus plantarum ZDY2013 were intragastrically administered for 2 weeks to alleviate HSD-induced renal injury. For the study, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, non-targeted metabonomics, real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR, and Masson’s staining were used to investigate the mechanism of L. plantarum ZDY2013 in alleviating renal damage. Results showed that HSD caused intestinal inflammation and changed the intestinal permeability of mice, disrupted the balance of intestinal flora, and increased toxic metabolites (tetrahydrocorticosteron (THB), 3-methyhistidine (3-MH), creatinine, urea, and L-kynurenine), resulting in serious kidney damage. Interestingly, L. plantarum ZDY2013 contributed to reconstructing the intestinal flora of mice by increasing the level of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium and decreasing that of Prevotella and Bacteroides. Moreover, the reconstructed intestinal microbiota significantly changed the concentration of the metabolites of hosts through metabolic pathways, including TCA cycle, ABC transport, purine metabolism, and histidine metabolism. The content of uremic toxins such as L-kynurenine, creatinine, and urea in the serum of mice was found to be decreased by L. plantarum ZDY2013, which resulted in renal injury alleviation. Our data suggest that L. plantarum ZDY2013 can indeed improve chronic kidney injury by regulating intestinal flora, strengthening the intestinal barrier, limiting inflammatory response, and reducing uremic toxins. © 2021 by the authors.

Volunteers were randomly divided into equal probiotic and placebo groups and changes in blood biochemical indicators, oxidative and inflammatory markers, and gut microbiota were examined after three weeks of probiotic intervention. The probiotic group’s antioxidant levels were significantly enhanced post-intervention. Total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) levels were significantly increased (p < 0.0001), while malondialdehyde (MDA) levels decreased (p < 0.05), and total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) levels increased, but with no significant difference. In addition, Interleukin-10 (IL-10) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) levels were significantly up-regulated and down-regulated (p < 0.05, respectively). Escherichia coli, Enterococcus, and Bacteroides expression was significantly reduced (p < 0.05), while Clostridium leptum, Bifidobacterium, and Lactobacillus expression increased (p < 0.05).

By replacing antibiotics with non-antibiotic additives (are alternatives to antibiotics, ATAs) like phytogenic feed additives and organic acids in poultry feed. ATAs are a potential alternative as these decline the proliferation of pathogenic bacteria and strengthen gut function in broiler chickens. In this study, we use 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing of the V3-V4 region to evaluate phytogenic feed additives and organic acids on the cecal microbial diversity of broiler chickens. Methods and results: Two hundred & forty broiler chicks were divided into five treatments comprising: a controlled basal diet (CON), antibiotic group (AB), phytogenic feed additives (PHY), organic acids (ORG), and a combination of PHY + ORG (COM). A distinctive microbial community structure was observed amongst different treatments with increased microbial diversity in AB, ORG, and COM (p < 0.05). The synergistic effects of PHY and ORG increased bacterial population of phyla: Firmicutes, Bacteroides, and Proteobacteria in the cecum. The presence of species, Akkermansia muciniphila (involved in mucin degradation) and Bacillus safensis (a probiotic bacterium) were noticed in COM and PHY, respectively. Clustering analysis revealed a higher relative abundance of similar microbial community composition between AB and ORG groups. Conclusions: Treatments with PHY and ORG modified the relative abundance and presence/absence of specific microbiota in the chicken cecum. Hence, cecal microbiota modulation through diet is a promising strategy to reduce cross-contamination of zoonotic poultry pathogens, led to healthy and economical broiler meat. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",

Since improving gut health of such animals is an emerging research field, the Simulator of the Canine Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem (SCIME™) was recently developed and validated with in vivo data. The current study presents a further improvement of this model by using an alternative method for feed preparation, i.e. by administering digestive enzymes to mimic upper gastro-intestinal digestion followed by a dialysis approach to mimic small intestinal absorption. As opposed to the previously implemented method, this resulted in a more optimal simulation of protein digestion and absorption. Further, upon entrance in the colon, increased production of the health-promoting butyrate and lower levels of Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacterium spp. were observed, which corresponded better with obtained in vivo data. A second model improvement consisted of the implementation of a mucosal environment to not only simulate luminal but also mucosal microbiota. In consistency with the human model for which this technology was previously validated, it was found that for all canine microbiota mucin beads were enriched with members of the Lachnospiraceae (~ Clostridium cluster XIVa), a family containing multiple well-known butyrate producers. The SCIME™ was thus upgraded to a so-called Mucosal SCIME™ (M-SCIME™). In conclusion, the current study presents improvements of the SCIME™, further increasing the relevance of obtained data with this in vitro model for dogs. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",

Their depolymerisation is catalyzed by β-mannanases. We have investigated a cell-surface exposed and galactose-tolerant β-mannanase (BoMan26B) from the abundant gut bacterium Bacteroides ovatus. Glycosidases from the gut microbiota have potential for production of prebiotics, such as dietary saccharides that would promote beneficial bacteria in the gut. BoMan26B was explored for production of potential prebiotics. Using the above β-mannans as substrate we investigated the product profiles using a herein developed new high-resolution anion-exchange chromatography procedure. The produced linear and galactosyl-decorated β-mannan-oligosaccharides (MOS/GMOS) were mainly of degree of polymerization (DP) 2–6, consistent with the glycan-binding subsites of BoMan26B. Some GM and AcGGM products were acetylated. DP 2–6 MOS were produced at a yield of 30 and 33% (w/w) from GM and AcGGM, respectively. In addition, about as much DP 2–6 GMOS were produced, assessed using guar α-galactosidase as analytical aid. Growth studies using the human gut bacteria Bifidobacterium adolescentis ATCC 15703 (acetate producer) and Roseburia hominis DSMZ 6839 (butyrate producer) revealed significant differences in utilization of specific MOS/GMOS. The prebiotic potential of the MOS/GMOS generated by BoMan26B was further underlined by the observation that both bacterial strains produced short-chain fatty acids. © 2021 The Authors",1.0

An impaired intestinal epithelial barrier is an important component of GVHD pathogenesis. However, contributing host factors that modulate mucosal barrier integrity during GVHD are poorly defined. We hypothesized that vitamin A and retinoic acid (RA) exert positive impacts on maintaining intestinal barrier function after HSCT, thus preventing or dampening GVHD severity. Unexpectedly, we found that exogenous RA increased intestinal permeability of recipient mice after allogeneic HSCT. Serum bacterial endotoxin levels were significantly higher in GVHD mice fed a vitamin A-high (VAH) diet compared to those fed a vitamin A-normal (VAN) diet, indicating a more compromised intestinal barrier function. Furthermore, VAH mice showed more severe lung GVHD with increased donor T cell infiltration in this tissue and died significantly faster than VAN recipients. 16S rRNA sequencing of fecal samples revealed significant differences in the diversity and composition of gut microbiota between VAN and VAH transplant recipients. Collectively, we show that retinoic acid signaling may negatively impact intestinal barrier function during GVHD. Mild vitamin A supplementation is associated with increased lung GVHD and more profound gut dysbiosis. Micronutrients such as vitamin A could modulate complications of allogeneic HSCT, which may be mediated by shaping gut microbiota. © Copyright © 2021 Pan, Atkinson, Taylor, Zhu, Zhou, Flejsierowicz, Wang, Morse, Liu, Gunsolus and Chen.",

Although a number of studies have reported alteration in gut microbiota following radiation, little is known about its dynamic variation in the progression of acute RIII. In this study, mouse model were treated with total body irradiation (TBI) of 0, 4, 8 and 12 Gy, and the intestinal tissues and fecal samples were collected at 6 h, 3.5 d and 7 d post radiation. We found that the intestinal injuries were manifested in a radiation dose-dependent manner. Results from 16S rRNA gene sequencing demonstrated that the diversity of gut microbiota was not significantly affected at the prodromal stage of acute RIII, after 6 h of radiation. At the critical stage of acute RIII, after 3.5 d of radiation, the composition of gut microbiota was correlated with the radiation dose. The Pearson’s correlation analysis showed that the relative abundances of phylum Proteobacteria, genera Escherichia-Shigella and Eubacterium xylanophilum_group, and species Lactobacillus murinus exhibited linear correlations with radiation dose. At the recovery stage of acute RIII, after 7 d of radiation, the diversity of gut microbiota decreased as a whole, among which the relative abundance of phyla Proteobacteria and Bacteroides increased, while that of phylum Tenericutes and genus Roseburia decreased. The intra-gastric administration of compound probiotics for 14 days improved the survival duration of mice exposed to 9 Gy TBI, alleviated the intestinal epithelial injury and partially restored the diversity of gut microbiota. Our findings suggest that acute RIII is accompanied by the dysbiosis of gut microbiota, including its decreased diversity, reduced abundance of beneficial bacteria and increased abundance of pathogens. The gut microbiota cannot be used as sensitive biomarkers at the prodromal stage in acute RIII, but are potential biomarkers at the critical stage of acute RIII. The dysbiosis is persistent until the recovery stage of acute RIII, and interventions are needed to restore it. The administration of probiotics is an effective strategy to protect against acute RIII and subsequent dysbiosis. Copyright © 2021 Zhao, Xie, Cai, Xu, Zhou, Tang, Yang, Fang, Li and Tian.",

Astaxanthin (AST) from Haematococcus pluvialis, a natural carotenoid, exhibits antioxidant, anti-lipogenic, anti-diabetic and other potent effects. Herein, we evaluated the effect of AST to illuminate its efficacy and mechanisms in high-fat diet-fed mice. AST supplementation not only significantly decreased body weight and lipid droplet accumulation in the liver but also modulated liver function and serum lipid levels. Lipidomic analysis revealed that 13 lipids might be potential biomarkers responsible for the effects of AST in lipid reduction, such as total free fatty acids (FFAs), triacylglycerols (TGs) and cholesterol esters (CEs). The gut microbiota sequencing results indicated that AST alleviated HFD-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis by optimizing the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroides and inhibiting the abundance of obesity-related pathogenic microbiota while promoting the abundance of probiotics related to glucose and lipid metabolism. In addition, qRT-PCR demonstrated that AST could regulate the gene expressions of the AMPK/SREBP1c pathway by downregulating lipogenesis correlated-genes and upregulating the lipid oxidant related-gene.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of LA on the intestinal barrier, immune functions, serum metabolism, and gut microbiota of broilers under lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge. A total of 384 one-day-old broilers were randomly divided into four groups, and fed with a basal diet, or a basal diet supplemented with 75 mg/kg antibiotic (ANT), or a basal diet supplemented with 1000 mg/kg LA. After 42 days of feeding, three groups were intraperitoneally injected with 0.5 mg/kg Escherichia coli- derived LPS (LPS, ANT+LPS and LA+LPS groups) for three consecutive days, and the control (CON) group was injected with the same volume of saline. Then, the birds were sacrificed. Results showed that LA pretreatment significantly alleviated the weight loss and intestinal mucosal injuries caused by LPS challenge. LA enhanced immune functions and inhibited inflammatory responses by upregulating the concentrations of immunoglobulins (IgA, IgM, and IgY), decreasing IL-6 and increasing IL-4 and IL-10. Metabolomics analysis revealed a significant difference of serum metabolites by LA pretreatment. Twenty-seven serum metabolic biomarkers were identified and mostly belong to lipids. LA also markedly modulated the pathway for sphingolipid metabolism, suggesting its ability to regulate lipid metabolism. Moreover,16S rRNA analysis showed that LA inhibited LPS-induced gut dysbiosis by altering cecal microbial composition (reducing Escherichia-Shigella, Barnesiella and Alistipes, and increasing Lactobacillus and Bacteroides), and modulating the production of volatile fatty acids (VFAs). Pearson’s correlation assays showed that alterations in serum metabolism and gut microbiota were strongly correlated to the immune factors; there were also strong correlations between serum metabolites and microbiota composition. The results highlight the potential of LA as a dietary supplement to combat bacterial LPS challenge in animal production and to promote food safety. © Copyright © 2021 Wu, Li, Liu, Liu, Xu, Zhang, Yu, Wang and Yang.",2.0

However, the toxicity of tartrazine (TZ), one of the most common azo-dyes, is still unclear, and needs to be ascertained by further study. Hence, in the present study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of TZ consumption on health by using a teleost, crucian carp (Carassius auratus) as the experimental fish. TZ consumption (1.4, 5.5 and 10 mg/kg bwt/day) could cause severe histopathological and cellular alterations in intestine and liver. The height of intestinal villus, thickness of intestinal muscle, and microvilli density were also affected. With the increasing of TZ concentrations, the activities of antioxidant enzymes (CAT, SOD and GSH-Px), exhibited a decreasing trend, while the contents of MDA elevated. Upregulations of pro-inflammatory cytokines (il6 and tnfα), anti-inflammatory cytokines (il8, and il10) and other immune related genes (complement component 3 (c3), lysozymes (lyz), β-defensin 3 (defb3)), were observed after TZ uptake. In addition, TZ consumption also affected the community structure of the microbiota in the intestine of crucian carp. The amount of some probiotic bacteria (Roseomonas, Rhodococcus and Bacillus) and the bacteria (Bacteroides and Clostridium), producing short chain fatty acids, were significantly reduced, and some pathogenetic microorganisms (e.g. Bdellovibrio and Shewanella) were significantly increased after TZ uptake. In summary, the data in the present study indicate that TZ consumption, even at a low concentration, may lead to adverse effects on fish health. Therefore, in aquaculture, it is necessary to be informed about the hazardous effects of TZ, and more attentions should be focused on using natural substitutes. © 2021 The Authors",3.0

Though antibiotic therapy can reduce death rate of sepsis significantly, it impairs gut microbiota (GM), which play imperative roles in human health. In this study, we compared the therapeutic effects of antibiotics, probiotics, and Chinese medicine QRD on the survival rates of septic model and observed the GM characteristics of experimental rats via 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. The 72 h survival rates of septic rat demonstrated the significant therapeutic effects in the three groups treated with antibiotics (AT), Chinses medicine QRD (QT), and probiotics (PT), which were elevated from the survival rate of 26.67% for the sepsis control group (ST) to 100.0% for AT, 88.24% for QT, and 58.33% for PT. The original characteristics of GM identified in the sham operation controls (SC) were relatively similar to those in PT and QT; nevertheless, the AT rats were shown dramatically decreased in the GM diversity. In addition, the septic rats in AT were revealed the higher abundances of Escherichia Shigella, Proteus, Morganella, Enterococcus, and Lysinibacillus, but the lower those of Parabacteroides, Alistipes, Desulfovibrio, Bacteroides, Helicobacter, Mucispirillum, Oscillibacter, Lachnospiraceae, and Ruminiclostridium 9, when compared to the PT and QT rats. By contrast, the GM of PT and QT rats shared similar diversity and structure. Our findings indicated that QRD increased the survival rates without impairment of the GM characteristics, which provides novel insights into the role of Chinese medicine in therapy and long-term recovery of sepsis. © Copyright © 2021 Cao, Zong, Dai, Gao, Li, Wu, Li, Tang and Wu.",

Imbalances of gut microbiota have been previously linked to respiratory virus infection. Understanding how the gut–lung axis affects the progression of COVID-19 can provide a novel framework for therapies and management. In this study, we examined the gut microbiota of patients with COVID-19 (n = 47) and compared it to healthy controls (n = 19). Using shotgun metagenomic sequencing, we have identified four microorganisms unique in COVID-19 patients, namely Streptococcus thermophilus, Bacteroides oleiciplenus, Fusobacterium ulcerans, and Prevotella bivia. The abundances of Bacteroides stercoris, B. vulgatus, B. massiliensis, Bifidobacterium longum, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lachnospiraceae bacterium 5163FAA, Prevotella bivia, Erysipelotrichaceae bacterium 6145, and Erysipelotrichaceae bacterium 2244A were enriched in COVID-19 patients, whereas the abundances of Clostridium nexile, Streptococcus salivarius, Coprococcus catus, Eubacterium hallii, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Adlercreutzia equolifaciens were decreased (p < 0.05). The relative abundance of butyrate-producing Roseburia inulinivorans is evidently depleted in COVID-19 patients, while the relative abundances of Paraprevotella sp. and the probiotic Streptococcus thermophilus were increased. We further identified 30 KEGG orthology (KO) modules overrepresented, with 7 increasing and 23 decreasing modules. Notably, 15 optimal microbial markers were identified using the random forest model to have strong diagnostic potential in distinguishing COVID-19. Based on Spearman’s correlation, eight species were associated with eight clinical indices. Moreover, the increased abundance of Bacteroidetes and decreased abundance of Firmicutes were also found across clinical types of COVID-19. Our findings suggest that the alterations of gut microbiota in patients with COVID-19 may influence disease severity.

Objectives: This study compared the composition and changes of the intestinal flora of pregnant women with mild thalassemia to those of healthy pregnant women using metagenomic sequencing technology and evaluated the potential microecological risk for pregnant women and the fetus. Methods: The present study was carried out on 14 mild thalassemia pregnant women with similar backgrounds in the Affiliated Hospital of Putian University, Fujian, China. In the same period, 6 healthy pregnant women were selected as the control group. The genomic deoxyribonucleic acid was extracted from the sable stool samples of pregnant women. Illumina HiSeq sequencing technology was adopted after library preparation. Prodigal software (ver 2.6.3), Salmon software (ver 1.6.0), and Kraken software (ver 2) were used to analyze the sequence data. Moreover, analysis of variance and Duncan’s multiple-comparison test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test were used as statistical methods. Results: The characteristics of the intestinal flora of pregnant women with mild thalassemia differed significantly from those of healthy pregnant women, showing an increase in some conditionally pathogenic bacteria (e.g., Prevotella stercorea rose and Escherichia coli) and a decrease in some probiotic bacteria, which might affect pregnant women and cause physiological function damage to their offspring by changing metabolic pathways; however, further validation is needed. Conclusions: The diversity and composition of intestinal flora in pregnant women with mild thalassemia vary significantly from those in healthy pregnant women, especially at the genus and species levels, representing more profound alterations in intestinal microecology. © 2021, Author(s).",

Oral supplementation with lactic acid bacteria (LAB) has been reported to alleviate cadmium toxi-city. However, research on the mitigation of cadmium toxicity by LAB is still limited to inorganic cadmium, which is not representative of the varied forms of cadmium ingested daily. In this study, different foodborne forms of cadmium were adopted to establish an in vivo toxicity model, including cadmium–glutathione, cadmium–citrate, and cadmium–metallothionein. The ability of Lactobacillus plantarum CCFM8610 to reduce the toxic effects of these forms of cadmium was further investigated. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metabolomics technologies based on liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) were adopted for the exploration of relevant protective mechanisms. The results demonstrated that the consumption of CCFM8610 can reduce the content of cadmium in mice and relieve the oxidative stress caused by different food–derived forms of cadmium, indicating that CCFM8610 has a promising effect on the remediation of the toxic effects of cadmium food poisoning. Meanwhile, protective effects on gut microflora and serum metabolites might be an important mechanism for probiotics to alleviate cadmium toxicity. This study provides a theoretical basis for the application of L. plantarum CCFM8610 to alleviate human cadmium poisoning. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",

There are few effective treatments, particularly systemic ones. Targeting aquaprin-5 (AQP5)-mediated tear secretion has been tested as a novel ancillary strategy and has proved promising. Patients have a great interest in using complementary medicine, including nutraceuticals and bioactive compounds to alleviate their symptoms. Potential mechanisms by which phytocompounds and bioactive compounds may benefit SS ocular and mouth symptoms through modulation of AQP5 activity are presented within this review. Supplementation with prebiotics (such as polyphenols with high bioavailability) in SS patients with lower Firmicutes/Bacteroides (F/B) community ratio phenotype, through administration of butyrate-producing diets, is proposed as ancillary strategy for dry eye and mouth. The potential use of natural bioactive compounds to treat dry eye could also apply to dry mouth occurring in the context of aging and SS. This novel hypothesis could have implications with respect to planning a successful dietary regimen for achieving and maintaining a normal gut microbiota in SS patients. This regimen would include augmenting butyrate-producing foodstuffs and/or polyphenol-rich syrups, and high amounts of some specific probiotic-rich foodstuffs such as yogurt, soy yogurt, or as probiotic supplements. There are applications for pharmaceutical and nutraceutical products aiming to relieve dry eye and mouth. © Copyright 2021, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2021.",

Summary: Major advances in analytical methods have led to an increased number of studies that combine gut microbiota and neuroimaging, mainly magnetic resonance imaging, to elucidate the mechanisms. Observational studies have been done to examine brain characteristics related to gut microbiota profiles, and intervention studies have examined brain changes related to probiotic intake. Studies of healthy subjects using negative emotional stimuli have shown that the pattern of emotional response differs depending on the gut microbiota profile and that probiotic intervention can modulate emotional response and be a buffer against the negative effects of stress. In studies on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a typical psychosomatic disorder, IBS-specific gut microbiota were reported to contribute to visceral irritability and pain by affecting the subcortical regions. Studies on psychiatric disorders revealed that a relative abundance of Bacteroides that produce γ-aminobutyric acid in feces was associated with a change in brain function specific to depression and that gut microbiota have an influence on abnormalities in the reward system of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. © 2021",2.0

We show that the administration of Bacteroides uniformis CECT 7771 (B. uniformis) in a rat FA model impacts on the brain reward response, ameliorating binge eating and decreasing anxiety-like behavior. These effects are mediated, at least in part, by changes in the levels of dopamine, serotonin, and noradrenaline in the nucleus accumbens and in the expression of dopamine D1 and D2 receptors in the prefrontal cortex and intestine. B. uniformis reverses the fasting-induced microbiota changes and increases the abundance of species linked to healthy metabolotypes.

Here, we report the structural basis of a PUL cluster, BdPUL12, which controls β-mannan-like glycan catabolism in Bacteroides dorei. Detailed biochemical characterization and targeted gene disruption studies demonstrated that a key glycoside hydrolase, BdP12GH26, performs the initial attack on galactomannan or glucomannan likely via an endo-acting mode, generating mannooligosaccharides and mannose.

These effects can be particularly significant for early life stress (ELS), or adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). In this review, we explore whether stress gets “into the belly,” that is, whether psychosocial stress affects the gut microbiome. We review animal and human research utilizing a variety of stress paradigms (acute laboratory stressors, chronic stress, stressful life events, perceived stress, ELS, in utero stress) and their impacts on the gut microbiota, with a particular focus on ELS. We also review data on dietary interventions to moderate impact of stress on the gut microbiome. Our review suggests strong evidence that acute laboratory stress, chronic stress, and ELS affect the gut microbiota in rodents, and growing evidence that perceived stress and ELS may impact the gut microbiota in humans. Emerging data also suggests, particularly in rodents, that dietary interventions such as omega-3 fatty acids and pre- and pro-biotics may buffer against the effects of stress on the gut microbiome, but more research is needed.

Here, the anti-diabetic effects and underlying mechanisms of Lactobacillus casei LC89 are investigated in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) mice, which was induced by a high-fat diet (HFD) with streptozotocin (100 mg per kg BW). The results show that LC89 at a dose of 109 CFU day-1 decreases fasting blood glucose (FBG) and insulin levels by 35.12% and 28.37%, respectively, compared to the diabetes control (DC) group. Moreover, LC89 treatment improved the insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR), serum lipid profiles and inflammation cytokines.

Aim of the study: To determine the underlying mechanism of the superiority of FFXHC over BBR in IC. Materials and methods: The susceptibility of Candida albicans to FFXHC was evaluated in vitro. The mouse model of IC was established and the survival rate, weight change, the number of organ colonies, and immune organ coefficient of the mice were determined, the effect of FFXHC on the immune function of mice, including changes in the number of immune cells, levels of the related inflammatory cytokines (INF-γ, TNF-α, MCP-1, IL-6, and IL-17A), and the antimicrobial peptide, LL-37 (CRAMP in mice), were determined. Mice feces were collected and changes in the intestinal microecology were studied. Results: Our findings indicated that FFXHC was not active against Candida albicans and did not restore the sensitivity of the resistant strain in vitro; however, it had a therapeutic effect that improve survival rate on mice with IC. The number of lymphocytes and neutrophils of mice with IC treated with FFXHC increased significantly. The intestinal microecology of mice was restored and the abundance of the probiotic Bacteroides was increased, which further stimulated the production of the antimicrobial peptide, LL-37, which is required for acquired immunity. Furthermore, the levels of Th cell-related cytokines, including INF-γ, TNF-α, and IL-17A were significantly increased, whereas those of the proinflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and MCP-1, decreased. With the activation of acquired immunity, the immune function of mice was restored, the body weight and survival rate of mice improved considerably, the coefficients of the thymus and spleen increased, and the number of fungal colonies in the lung and kidney decreased. Conclusions: FFXHC could eliminate fungi by increasing the relative abundance of probiotics in Bacteroides and the number of neutrophils, thereby promoting the production of CRAMP and resulting in a fungicidal effect, leading to acquired immunity.

While in general ENMs do not seem to have detrimental effects on immunity or induce severe inflammation, their indirect effects on immunity are less known. In particular, since the gut microbiota has been tightly associated with human health and immunity, it is possible that ingested ENMs could affect intestinal immunity indirectly by modulating the microbial community composition and functions. In this perspective, we provide a few pieces of evidence and discuss a possible link connecting ENM exposure, gut microbiota and host immune response. Some experimental works suggest that excessive exposure to ENMs could reshape the gut microbiota, thereby modulating the epithelium integrity and the inflammatory state in the intestine. Within such microenvironment, numerous microbiota-derived components, including but not limited to SCFAs and LPS, may serve as important effectors responsible of the ENM effect on intestinal immunity. Therefore, the gut microbiota is implicated as a crucial regulator of the intestinal immunity upon ENM exposure. This calls for including gut microbiota analysis within future work to assess ENM biocompatibility and immunosafety. This also calls for refinement of future studies that should be designed more elaborately and realistically to mimic the human exposure situation. © Copyright © 2021 Tang, Li, Wei, Hou, Qu and Li.",2.0

However, little is known about the fecal bile acid profiles and their association with gut microbiota dysbiosis in pediatric NAFLD. A total of 68 children were enrolled in this study, including 32 NAFLD patients and 36 healthy children. Fecal samples were collected and analyzed by metagenomic sequencing to determine the changes in the gut microbiota of children with NAFLD, and an ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) system was used to quantify the concentrations of primary and secondary bile acids. The associations between the gut microbiota and concentrations of primary and secondary bile acids in the fecal samples were then analyzed. We found that children with NAFLD exhibited reduced levels of secondary bile acids and alterations in bile acid biotransforming-related bacteria in the feces. Notably, the decrease in Eubacterium and Ruminococcaceae bacteria, which express bile salt hydrolase and 7α-dehydroxylase, was significantly positively correlated with the level of fecal lithocholic acid (LCA). However, the level of fecal LCA was negatively associated with the abundance of the potential pathogen Escherichia coli that was enriched in children with NAFLD. Pediatric NAFLD is characterized by an altered profile of gut microbiota and fecal bile acids. This study demonstrates that the disease-associated gut microbiota is linked with decreased concentrations of secondary bile acids in the feces. The disease-associated gut microbiota likely inhibits the conversion of primary to secondary bile acids. © Copyright © 2021 Yu, Zhang, Chen, Ruan, Chen and Liu.",3.0

To investigate the effects of Paenibacillus polymyxa 10 and Lactobacillus plantarum 16 on the growth performance and intestinal health of broilers, 540 male Cobb 500 broilers of 1 d old were randomly divided into 3 groups with 6 replicates per group and 30 chicks per replicate. Broilers were fed with either a basal diet or basal diets supplemented with 1 × 108 colony-forming units (CFU)/kg P. polymyxa 10 (BSC10) or L. plantarum 16 (Lac16) for 42 d. Results showed that Lac16 treatment improved (P &lt; 0.05) the growth performance (body weight and feed conversion) of broilers at the starter phase, while BSC10 treatment slightly improved (P &gt; 0.05) the growth performance of the starter phase broilers. The increased villus height (P &lt; 0.05) at d 14, 21 and 42 and villus height to crypt depth ratio (P &lt; 0.05) at d 14 and 21 were observed in the ileum of the 2 probiotic groups. Besides, transmission electron microscopy results showed that the 2 probiotics enhanced the intestinal epithelial barrier. Both probiotic treatments up-regulated (P &lt; 0.05) the mRNA expression of fatty acid binding protein 1 (FABP1) and sodium-dependent glucose transporters-1 (SGLT-1) in the ileal mucosa of broilers at d 21. In addition, BSC10 and Lac16 treatments significantly (P &lt; 0.05) increased the relative abundance of short-chain fatty acids-producing bacteria, such as Butyricicoccus pullicaecorum, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Lachnospira and Coprococcu, and significantly (P &lt; 0.05) decreased the relative abundance of enteric pathogens (Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis and Shigella sonnei). Furthermore, the 2 probiotic treatments also increased the positive connection among the intestinal microbes and the carbohydrate metabolism-related pathways of the intestinal bacteria (P &lt; 0.05), with decreasing (P &lt; 0.05) nucleotides biosynthesis-related pathways of the intestinal bacteria. Overall, these results suggest that the 2 probiotics, especially Lac16, have a potential beneficial effect on the growth performance and intestinal health of starter phase broilers. © 2021 Chinese Association of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine",5.0

Modulation of human gut microbiota through pro-and prebiotic interventions has yielded promising results; however, the effect of novel prebiotics, such as chitin–glucan, on gut microbiota–host interplay is still not fully characterized. We assessed the effect of chitin–glucan (CG) and chitin–glucan plus Bifidobac-terium breve (CGB) on human gut microbiota from the luminal and mucosal environments in vitro. Further, we tested the effect of filter-sterilized fecal supernatants from CG and CGB fermentation for protective effects on inflammation-induced barrier disruption and cytokine production using a co-culture of enterocytes and macrophage-like cells. Overall, CG and CGB promote health-beneficial short-chain fatty acid production and shift human gut microbiota composition, with a consistent effect increasing Roseburia spp. and butyrate producing-bacteria. In two of three donors, CG and CGB also stimulated Faecalibacterium prausniitzi. Specific colonization of B. breve was observed in the lumen and mucosal compartment; however, no synergy was detected for different endpoints when comparing CGB and CG. Both treatments included a significant improvement of inflammation-disrupted epithelial barrier and shifts on cytokine production, especially by consistent increase in the immunomodulatory cytokines IL10 and IL6. © 2021 by the authors.

The study aim was to assess the effect in Hp patients of a Test fermented milk containing yogurt and Lacticaseibacillus (L. paracasei CNCM I-1518 and I-3689, L. rhamnosus CNCM I-3690) strains on antibiotic associated diarrhea (AAD) (pri-mary aim), GI-symptoms, gut microbiota, and metabolites. A randomised, double-blind, controlled trial was performed on 136 adults under 14-day Hp treatment, receiving the Test or Control product for 28 days. AAD and GI-symptoms were reported and feces analysed for relative and quantitative gut microbiome composition, short chain fatty acids (SCFA), and calprotectin concentrations, and viability of ingested strains. No effect of Test product was observed on AAD or GI-symptoms. Hp treatment induced a significant alteration in bacterial and fungal composition, a decrease of bacterial count and alpha-diversity, an increase of Candida and calprotectin, and a decrease of SCFA con-centrations. Following Hp treatment, in the Test as compared to Control group, intra-subject beta-diversity distance from baseline was lower (padj = 0.02), some Enterobacteriaceae, including Esche-richia-Shigella (padj = 0.0082) and Klebsiella (padj = 0.013), were less abundant, and concentrations of major SCFA (p = 0.035) and valerate (p = 0.045) were higher. Viable Lacticaseibacillus strains were detected during product consumption in feces. Results suggest that, in patients under Hp treatment, the consumption of a multi-strain fermented milk can induce a modest but significant faster recovery of the microbiota composition (beta-diversity) and of SCFA production and limit the increase of potentially pathogenic bacteria. © 2021 by the authors.

We aim to review the current directions of GWI pathology research in the context of chronic multisymptomatic illness and its possible gut microbiome targeted therapies. The veterans of Gulf War show symptoms of chronic fatigue, cognitive deficits, and a subsection report of gastrointestinal complications. Method: Efforts of finding a suitable treatment regimen and clinical management remain a challenge. More recently, we have shown that the pathology is connected to alterations in the gut microbiome, and efforts of finding a suitable regimen for gut-directed therapeutics are underway. We discuss the various clinical interventions and summarize the possible effectiveness of gut-directed therapies such as the use of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), phenolic compounds, and their metabolites, use of probiotics, and fecal microbiota transfer. Significance: The short review will be helpful to GWI researchers to expand their studies to the gut and find an effective treatment strategy for chronic multisymptomatic illness. © 2021",

In the absence of a licensed vaccine, efforts to evaluate prophylactic agents are underway. The prophylactic efficacy of a twice-daily, 550 mg dose of the antibiotic rifaximin demonstrated no efficacy against campylobacteriosis in a controlled human infection model (CHIM); however, samples from the CHIM study were utilized to assess how the human gut microbiome responds to C. jejuni infection, and if a ‘protective’ microbiota exists in study participants not developing campylobacteriosis. Statistically significant, but minor, differences in study participant beta diversity were identified during the challenge period (p = 0.002, R2 = 0.042), but no significant differences were otherwise observed. Pre-challenge alpha diversity was elevated in study participants who did not develop campylobacteriosis compared to those who did (p &lt; 0.001), but alpha diversity declined in all study participants from the pre-challenge period to post-discharge.

Mice that received B[a]P alone served as the model group. Each mouse in the L. plantarum treatment groups were administered 2×109 colony forming unit (CFU) of L. plantarum strains once daily, followed by an oral dose of B[a]P at 50 mg/kg body weight. Behavior, biochemical indicators in the colon and brain tissue, and the gut microbiota composition and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) levels in the gut were investigated. Compared to the treatment in the model group, CCFM8661 treatment effectively reduced oxidative stress in the brain, improved behavioral performance, increased intestinal barrier integrity, and alleviated histopathological changes in mice. Moreover, CCFM8661 increased the gut microbiota diversity and abundance of Ruminococcus and Lachnospiraceae and reduced the abundance of pro-inflammatory Turicibacter spp. Additionally, the production of SCFAs was significantly increased by L. plantarum CCFM8661.

A T2D rat model was established by inducing Sprague-Dawley rats with HFD/STZ, followed by 12-weeks L. paracasei NL41 gavage. The blood, colonic tissues, and feces samples of these rats were collected for inflammation, histology, and intestinal microbiota profiling. L. paracasei NL41 treatment induced remarkable improvement in the inflammatory status by decreasing the levels of serum lipopolysaccharides (LPS), free fatty acids (FFA), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-8 and increasing the level of IL-10. Gut barrier function was significantly protected in NL41-treated rats. Moreover, the strain NL41 induced changes in the microbiota structure and influenced the relative abundance of the key species. Specifically, Bacteroides, Clostridia (specifically, Ruminococcus torques), and Parasutterella were significantly reduced, while some beneficial microorganisms (Bacteroidales_S24-7_group and the families Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae) were enriched by NL41.

The health benefits provided by dietary manipulation of the HGM require knowledge of how glycans, the major nutrients available to this ecosystem, are metabolized. Arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs) are a ubiquitous feature of plant polysaccharides available to the HGM. Although the galactan backbone and galactooligosaccharide side chains of AGPs are conserved, the decorations of these structures are highly variable. Here, we tested the hypothesis that these variations in arabinogalactan decoration provide a selection mechanism for specific Bacteroides species within the HGM. The data showed that only a single bacterium, B. plebeius, grew on red wine AGP (Wi-AGP) and seaweed AGP (SW-AGP) in mono-or mixed culture. Wi-AGP thus acts as a privileged nutrient for a Bacteroides species within the HGM that utilizes marine and terrestrial plant glycans. The B. plebeius polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs) upregulated by AGPs encoded a polysaccharide lyase, located in the enzyme family GH145, which hydrolyzed Rha-Glc linkages in Wi-AGP. Further analysis of GH145 identified an enzyme with two active sites that displayed glycoside hydrolase and lyase activities, respectively, which conferred substrate flexibility for different AGPs. The AGP-degrading apparatus of B. plebeius also contained a sulfatase, BpS1_8, active on SW-AGP and Wi-AGP, which played a pivotal role in the utilization of these glycans by the bacterium. BpS1_8 enabled other Bacteroides species to access the sulfated AGPs, providing a route to introducing privileged nutrient utilization into probiotic and commensal organisms that could improve human health. © 2021 Munoz-Munoz et al.",1.0

Over time this relationship is thought to shape critical aspects of human function such as metabolism, brain development, immune response, and overall gut health. Recent advances in technology have allowed us to begin understanding this complex relationship and have demonstrated that microbes within the gut ecosystem can be influ-enced by a variety of factors including mode of delivery, diet, and medication exposure, all of which can impact host health in either positive or detrimental ways. Perturbations of gut homeostasis have been implicated in many forms of digestive disease such as inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, Helicobacter pylori infection, and even in cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. As such, researchers have sought methods to either restore gut homeostasis or prevent dysregulation of the gut community, also known as dysbiosis, through an emerging field known as microbial therapeutics. Examples of existing modalities are reviewed here such as prebiotics, probiotics, fecal microbial trans-plantation, and dietary therapy. As these therapies become further substantiated through research and increasingly desired by patients and their families, there is a need for pro-viders caring for children to familiarize themselves with the existing data and indications for use. As we look to the future, machine-learning algorithms and more readily available next-generation sequencing of fecal samples may allow us to harness data from a per-son’s gut microbiota to predict response to a particular intervention and tailor therapeu-tic options with an aim toward precision medicine.

Although gut microbiota (GM) is a key contributor to host health, limited information is available for canines. Therefore, this study characterized GM according to individual signatures (e.g., breed, age, and body condition score—BCS) of dogs living in the same environment. Fresh fecal samples from 96 healthy dogs were analyzed by sequencing the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. The major microbial phyla were Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Fusobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria. In the comparison by breeds, relative abundance of Fusobacterium was significantly differed. Interestingly, Fusobacterium perfoetens abundance was positively correlated with age (p = 0.018), being significantly more enriched in the 6–10-year-old group (14.3%) than in the 0.5–1-year-old group (7.2%). Moreover, despite the healthy appearance of dogs in all age (0.5–10 years) and BCS (3–6) groups, the gut microbial environment may be disadvantageous in older dogs or in dogs with an abnormal BCS. These findings broaden our understanding of gut microbial ecology according to individual characteristics of dogs and may be used as a reference for providing customized-care to companion animals. © 2021 by the authors.

Lactis bb-12 protects against antibiotic-induced functional and compositional changes in human fecal microbiome,2021,Nutrients,10.3390/nu13082814,"The administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics is often associated with antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD), and impacts gastrointestinal tract homeostasis, as evidenced by the following: (a) an overall reduction in both the numbers and diversity of the gut microbiota, and (b) decreased short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production. Evidence in humans that probiotics may enhance the recovery of microbiota populations after antibiotic treatment is equivocal, and few studies have addressed if probiotics improve the recovery of microbial metabolic function. Our aim was to determine if Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12 (BB-12)-containing yogurt could protect against antibiotic-induced fecal SCFA and microbiota composition disruptions. We conducted a randomized, allocation-concealed, controlled trial of amoxicillin/clavulanate administration (days 1–7), in conjunction with either BB-12-containing or control yogurt (days 1–14). We measured the fecal levels of SCFAs and bacterial composition at baseline and days 7, 14, 21, and 30. Forty-two participants were randomly assigned to the BB-12 group, and 20 participants to the control group. Antibiotic treatment suppressed the fecal acetate levels in both the control and probiotic groups. Following the cessation of antibiotics, the fecal acetate levels in the probiotic group increased over the remainder of the study and returned to the baseline levels on day 30 (−1.6% baseline), whereas, in the control group, the acetate levels remained suppressed. Further, antibiotic treatment reduced the Shannon diversity of the gut microbiota, for all the study participants at day 7. The magnitude of this change was larger and more sustained in the control group compared to the probiotic group, which is consistent with the hypothesis that BB-12 enhanced microbiota recovery. There were no significant baseline clinical differences between the two groups. Concurrent administration of amoxicillin/clavulanate and BB-12 yogurt, to healthy subjects, was associated with a significantly smaller decrease in the fecal SCFA levels and a more stable taxonomic profile of the microbiota over time than the control group. © 2021 by the authors.

In this study, we assessed the effects of probiotic lactobacilli on behavioral reactions, the level of oxidative stress and microbiota content in mice administered to broad-spectrum antibiotics. Our study demonstrates that antibiotic treatment of adolescent mice for two weeks resulted in higher mortality and lower weight gain and induced significant changes in behavior including lower locomotor and exploratory activity, reduced muscle strength, visceral hypersensitivity, higher level of anxiety and impaired cognitive functions compared to the control group. These changes were accompanied by decreased diversity and total amount of bacteria, abundance of Proteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia phyla, and reduced Firmicutes/Bacteroides ratio in the gut microbiota. Moreover, a higher level of oxidative stress was found in brain and skeletal muscle tissues of mice treated with antibiotics. Oral administration of two Lactobacillus strains prevented the observed changes and improved not only microbiota content but also the behavioral alterations, suggesting a neuroprotective and antioxidant role of probiotics. © 2021 by the authors.

Previous data showed that marine-derived Bacillus amyloliquefaciens-9 (GB-9) improved the immunity and the nonspecific immune defense system of the body. In this study, the potential role of GB-9 in improving subclinical mastitis was assessed with Radix Tetrastigmae (RT) as a positive control in subclinical mastitis Saanen dairy goats. The current data showed that GB-9 and RT significantly reduced the SCC in dairy goats. After being fed with GB-9 or RT, the decreased concentrations of malondialdehyde, IgA, IgM, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-6 were observed. The amplicon sequencing analysis of fecal samples revealed that GB-9 significantly altered the bacterial community. Bacteroides and Phascolarctobacterium were the major genera that respond to GB-9 feeding. The correlation analysis using weighted gene co-expression network analysis showed a MePink module was most associated with the serum concentrations of immunoglobulin and interleukin. The MePink module contained 89 OTUs. The feeding of GB-9 in decreasing the SCC was associated with the altered abundance of Bacteroides, which was correlated with the concentrations of immunoglobulins and chemokines.

In addition, ginseng-SDF improved intestinal structures and enhanced fecal short-chain fatty acids concentrations (especially acetic acid and butyric acid). More importantly, ginseng-SDF affected the abundance of Firmicutes and Bacteroides, and significantly promoted the proliferation of probiotics and cellulolytic bacteria such as Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium and Ruminococcus_bromii.

This study aimed to assess the effect of a probiotic product (containing Lactobacillus casei Zhang, Lactobacillus plantarum P-8, and Bifdobacterium animalis subsp. lactis V9) as an adjunct to a routine regimen in IBS management. Methods: Forty-five patients with IBS were randomized into the probiotic (n = 24) and control (n = 21) groups, receiving the routine regimen with or without probiotics for 28 days, respectively. Serum and fecal samples were collected and analyzed. Results: The IBS-symptom severity score (P < 0.01), serum levels of IL-6 (P < 0.01) and TNF-α (P < 0.001) were significantly lower in the probiotic group than the control group at day 28. The probiotic adjunctive treatment resulted in significant decreases in some bacterial genera that worsen IBS, such as Bacteroides (P < 0.01), Escherichia (P < 0.05), and Citrobacter (P < 0.05), significant decreases were also observed in some beneficial genera in the control group, including Bifidobacterium (P < 0.05), Eubacterium (P < 0.05), Dorea (P < 0.01), and Butyricicoccus (P < 0.05). Furthermore, significant correlations were found between some monitored parameters and compositional changes in the fecal microbiota, suggesting that the clinical improvement of IBS was likely associated with gut microbiota modulation. The enterotype analysis revealed that the initial fecal microbiota composition could influence clinical outcomes. Conclusions: The adjunctive use of probiotics with a routine regimen showed additional clinical effectiveness compared to the routine regimen alone in managing IBS. A pretreatment gut microbiome analysis might help tailor a personalized probiotic regimen to optimize treatment effects. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",7.0

The aim of this systematic review was to assemble available data regarding the oral and gut microbiota in pSS and to compare them to data from healthy individuals and patients with dry symptoms without a diagnosis of Sjögren’s syndrome or lupus disease to identify dysbiosis and discuss the results. Methodology: Using the PRISMA guidelines, we systematically reviewed studies that compared the oral and gut microbiota of Sjögren’s patients and controls. The PubMed database and Google Scholar were searched. Results: Two-hundred and eighty-nine studies were found, and 18 studies were included: 13 referred to the oral microbiota, 4 referred to the gut microbiota, and 1 referred to both anatomical sites. The most frequent controls were healthy volunteers and patients with sicca symptoms. The most common analysis method used was 16S-targeted metagenomics. The results were mostly heterogeneous, and the results regarding diversity were not always in accordance. Dysbiosis in pSS was not confirmed, and reduced salivary secretion seems to explain more microbial changes than the underlying disease. Conclusion: These heterogeneous results might be explained by the lack of a standardized methodology at each step of the process and highlight the need for guidelines.

However, to establish disease progression markers, it is essential to assess alterations in the gut microbiota before disease onset. Here, a prospective metagenomic analysis of the gut microbiota of infants at risk of CD was done to track shifts in the microbiota before CD development. We performed cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses of gut microbiota, functional pathways, and metabolites, starting from 18 mo before CD onset, in 10 infants who developed CD and 10 matched nonaffected infants. Cross-sectional analysis at CD onset identified altered abundance of six microbial strains and several metabolites between cases and controls but no change in microbial species or pathway abundance. Conversely, results of longitudinal analysis revealed several microbial species/strains/pathways/metabolites occurring in increased abundance and detected before CD onset. These had previously been linked to autoimmune and inflammatory conditions (e.g., Dialister invisus, Parabacteroides sp., Lachnospiraceae, tryptophan metabolism, and metabolites serine and threonine). Others occurred in decreased abundance before CD onset and are known to have anti-inflammatory effects (e.g., Streptococcus thermophilus, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and Clostridium clostridioforme). Additionally, we uncovered previously unreported microbes/pathways/ metabolites (e.g., Porphyromonas sp., high mannose–type N-glycan biosynthesis, and serine) that point to CD-specific biomarkers. Our study establishes a road map for prospective longitudinal study designs to better understand the role of gut microbiota in disease pathogenesis and therapeutic targets to reestablish tolerance and/or prevent autoimmunity. © 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

Biochemical and 16S rDNA sequencing analysis identified A23 as Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, and a haemolytic test and antibiotic susceptibility test were carried out on strain A23 to determine its safety. First, the whole genome of B. amyloliquefaciens A23 was determined to explore its mechanism of action. The results showed that the total length of the genome was 3,974,398 bp, the GC content was 46.56%, and 3843 genes were encoded, including 27 rRNA operons and 86 transfer RNA genes. Three bacilysin-related genes and 10 antimicrobial peptide (AMP)-related genes were found through manual inspection. Second, we evaluated the beneficial effects of strain A23 in P. clarkii by performing in vivo feeding experiments. The results showed that probiotic supplementation could effectively enhance the intestinal digestive enzyme activities, innate immune enzyme activities and white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) resistance of P. clarkii. Finally, the intestinal microbial community and diversity of crayfish were compared and analyzed by high-throughput sequencing. At the phylum level, the abundance of Proteobacteria decreased with 108 CFU/g probiotics supplement, while the abundance of Firmicutes and Bacteroides increased. The Shannon index of the intestinal microorganism community of the 108 CFU/g probiotic supplementation group was significantly higher than that of the control group, indicateding that 108 CFU/g probiotic supplementation enhanced intestinal microbial diversity. The results from this study demonstrated that B. amyloliquefaciens A23 is a promising probiotic candidate that provides multiple benefits for crayfish cultivation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",3.0

Forty Chinese Holstein female newborn calves were randomly assigned to four treatments with 10 calves in each group, C (control group), T1 (0.5 g MSP/calf/day, T2 (1 g MSP/calf/day), and T3 (2 g MSP/calf/day) groups. The experimental period was 56 days. Feed intake and health scoring were recorded every day until the end of the experiment. Fecal contents and blood samples were sampled at WK2, WK4, WK6, and WK8. Growth performance, incidence of diarrhea, and total serum concentrations (IgA, IgG, and IgM) were analyzed. Bacterial 16S rRNA and fungal ITS genes were high-throughput sequenced for fecal microbiota. The relationships among the populations of the principal fecal microbiota at WK2 and the growth performance or serum immunoglobulin concentrations were analyzed using Pearson’s rank correlation coefficients. The MSP supplementation reduced the incidence of diarrhea in the first 4 weeks of life, and serum IgA, IgG, and IgM concentrations increased between WK2 and WK8 in the T3 group. There was an increase in growth performance and reduction in the incidence of diarrhea until WK4 after birth in T3 group, compared with the control, T1, and T2 groups. The results of fecal microbiota analysis showed that Firmicutes and Bacteroides were the predominant phyla, with Blautia, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-005, norank_f__Muribaculaceae, Bacteroides, Subdoligranulum, and Bifidobacterium being the dominant genera in calf feces. Aspergillus, Thermomyces, and Saccharomyces were the predominant fungal phyla. Compared with the control, in T1 and T2 groups, the MSP supplementation reduced the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes and increased the relative abundance of Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Collinsella, and Saccharomyces at WK2 in group T3. Thus, the fecal microbial composition and diversity was significantly affected by the MSP mixture during the first 2 weeks of the calves’ life. MSP mixtures reduced the incidence of diarrhea in pre-weaning calves (during the first 4 weeks of life). There was a significant improvement in growth performance, reduction in calf diarrhea, balance in the fecal microbiota, and an overall improvement in serum immunity, compared with the control group. We, therefore, recommend adding 2 g/day of multispecies probiotic mixture supplementation in diets of dairy calves during their first 4 weeks of life before weaning. © Copyright © 2021 Wu, Wang, Luo, Chen, Nie, Niu, Chen, Xu, Li and Zhang.",6.0

The existing evidence suggests that gut microbiota is capable of flavonoid biotransformation to generate bioactive metabolites including 2,4,6-trihydroxybenzoic acid (2,4,6-THBA), 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (3,4-DHBA), 3,4,5-trihyroxybenzoic acid (3,4,5-THBA) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC). In this study, we screened 94 human gut bacterial species for their ability to biotransform flavonoid quercetin into different metabolites. We demonstrated that five of these species were able to degrade quercetin including Bacillus glycinifermentans, Flavonifractor plautii, Bacteroides eggerthii, Olsenella scatoligenes and Eubacterium eligens. Additional studies showed that B. glycinifermentans could generate 2,4,6-THBA and 3,4-DHBA from quercetin while F. plautii generates DOPAC. In addition to the differences in the metabolites produced, we also observed that the kinetics of quercetin degradation was different between B. glycinifermentans and F. plautii, suggesting that the pathways of degradation are likely different between these strains. Similar to the antiproliferative effects of 2,4,6-THBA and 3,4-DHBA demonstrated previously, DOPAC also inhibited colony formation ex vivo in the HCT-116 colon cancer cell line. Consistent with this, the bacterial culture supernatant of F. plautii also inhibited colony formation in this cell line. Thus, as F. plautii and B. glycinifermentans generate metabolites possessing antiproliferative activity, we suggest that these strains have the potential to be developed into probiotics to improve human gut health. © 2021 by the authors.

While plant-derived bioactive products, such as phytobiotics, have shown great potential to mitigate these challenges, providing benefits such as antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities, their mechanisms of action remain largely unexplored. To gain more insight, a 21 day trial is conducted to investigate the effects of LiveXtract, a commercial plant-based product, using fecal samples as a proxy for gut bacteria in weaned pigs. High-throughput sequencing of amplicons targeting the V1–V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene is used to determine bacterial composition at days 1 (pre-treatment), 4, 10, and 21 postweaning. Our results show that Lactobacillaceae and Peptostreptococcaceae are both higher in the supplemented group at D4 (p < 0.05), while Streptococcaceae are significantly lower in the treated group at D10 and D21. At D10, Erysipelotrichaceae are lower, and Veillonellaceae are higher in the treated samples than the control group (p < 0.05). Of the thirteen abundant Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) that have different representation between treated and control pigs (p < 0.05), six are predicted to be lactate producers (affiliation to Lactobacillus or Streptococcus), and one is predicted to be a lactate utilizer, based on its high identity to Megasphaera elsdenii. Together, these data suggest that phytobiotics may provide a favorable metabolic equilibrium between lactate production and utilization. Lactate is considered a critical microbial end product in gut environments, as it can inhibit pathogens or be metabolized to propionate for utilization by host cells. © 2021 by the authors.

Crayfish were randomly assigned to six different boxes and two different groups in triplicate. The control group received a basal diet and the treatment group received a diet containing S. cerevisiae at 107 CFU/g. After feeding for 28 days, crayfish of the treatment group exhibited a significantly better weight gain ratio (WGR) and a specific growth rate (SGR) (p &lt; 0.05) than crayfish of the control group. Compared to the treatment group, the control group intestines showed an oedema connective tissue layer and a weak muscle layer. For immune-related genes, Crustin2 expression was similar between the groups, whereas Lysozyme and prophenoloxidase from treatment group expression levels were upregulated significantly (p &lt; 0.05) after 14 and 28 days of feeding. Prophenoloxidase showed the highest expression, with 10.5-and 8.2-fold higher expression than in the control group at 14 and 28 days, respectively. The intestinal microbiota community structure was markedly different between the two groups. After 14 and 28 days of feeding, the relative abundance of Cetobacterium and Lacto-bacillus increased, whereas Citrobacter and Bacteroides decreased in the treatment group compared with that of the control group. The challenge test showed that crayfish of the treatment group had a significantly enhanced resistance against Citrobacter freundii (p &lt; 0.05).

Given that probiotic feed additives, such as the commercial product Aviguard®, have been shown to be effective in reducing enteropathogens, such as Salmonella, in vertebrates, including livestock, we assessed potential anti-pathogenic and immune-modulatory properties of Aviguard® during acute C. jejuni-induced murine enterocolitis. Therefore, microbiota-depleted IL-10−/− mice were infected with C. jejuni strain 81-176 by gavage and orally treated with Aviguard® or placebo from day 2 to 4 post-infection. The applied probiotic bacteria could be rescued from the intestinal tract of treated mice, but with lower obligate anaerobic bacterial counts in C. jejuni-infected as compared to non-infected mice. Whereas comparable gastrointestinal pathogen loads could be detected in both groups until day 6 post-infection, Aviguard® treatment resulted in improved clinical outcome and attenuated apoptotic cell responses in infected large intestines during acute campylobacteriosis. Furthermore, less distinct pro-inflammatory immune responses could be observed not only in the intestinal tract, but also in extra-intestinal compartments on day 6 post-infection. In conclusion, we show here for the first time that Aviguard® exerts potent disease-alleviating effects in acute C. jejuni-induced murine enterocolitis and might be a promising probiotic treatment option for severe campylobacteriosis in humans. © 2021 by the authors.

Microbial communities have important effects on water environment stability and animal health. Therefore, in this study, we comparatively investigated the microbiota characteristics in the water, sediment and gastrointestinal tract of L. maculatus at two growth stages. 16S rDNA high-throughput sequencing analysis revealed that the microbial diversity of the sediment was higher than that of the water and gastrointestinal tract, but the diversity did not change with fish growth. In addition, the composition of dominant bacterial taxa is more complex in the water and sediment than in the gastrointestinal tract. Specifically, Proteobacteria and Bacteroides were the dominant bacteria in the intestine and culture environments, while Actinobacteria and Planctomycetes were dominant in the water, Chloroﬂexi and Acidobacteria were enriched in the sediment, and Firmicutes tended to colonize the gastrointestinal tract. Alternatively, some genera of putative pathogenic bacteria (Vibrio, Streptococcus, Escherichia-Shigella, Enterobacter and Staphylococcus) and beneficial bacteria (Bacillus and Lactobacillus) underwent obvious dynamic changes in the stomach and different sections of the intestine with fish growth, indicating that the prevention of pathogen infection needs to be strengthened in fish farming, especially for the regulation of fish gastrointestinal tract health.

Stachyose, an oligosaccharide, modulates the gut microbiota composition in animals. However, the role of stachyose in promoting the proliferation of probiotics and whether it inhibits pathogenic micro-organisms in human gut microbiota has not been explored. Therefore, in this study, the effects of stachyose on the gut microbiota and its metabolites in humans are explored. Three concentrations of stachyose are used as the sole carbon source for in vitro fermentation. Results show that stachyose improves beta diversity and increases the concentration of short-chain fatty acid (SCFAs), mainly acetic acid and butyric acid. Stachyose is found to promote the relative abundance of Bifidobacteria, Faecalibacterium, Lactobacillus, and Prevotella genera in the gut microbiota. Besides, stachyose significantly reduces the relative abundance of Bacteroides and Escherichia-Shigella genera. The findings show that stachyose increases beneficial microbiota, therefore, it is a useful prebiotic which modulates the composition of the gut microbiota. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH",

This study is designed to explore the therapeutic potential of metformin and montelukast, in combination with Lactobacillus, for modulation of intestinal flora and suppression of oxidative stress in testicular and liver damage in diabetic male rats. A DM model was induced by streptozotocin (STZ)which caused functional, biochemical, and inflammatory injuries to the testicular and liver tissues. The experimental panel included nine rat groups: normal control, normal control plus metformin, normal control plus montelukast, DM control, DM plus montelukast, DM plus a combination of metformin and Lactobacillus, DM plus a combination of montelukast and Lactobacillus, and DM plus a combination of metformin and montelukast. In parallel, clinical evaluation of microscopic examination scoring, and hepatic and testicular injuries, were evaluated. Biochemical markers including glucose level, lipid profile, inflammatory markers (tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-α) and interleukin-17 (IL-17), Caspase-3, and Bax proteins expressions were measured. The change in the microbiota abundance was investigated using conventional and real-time PCR. The current study revealed a significant difference in the relative abundance of microbiota, where DM is associated with an enormous increase of Bacteroides spp., Clostridium spp., E. coli, and Fusobacterium spp., and a significant decrease in Bifidobacteria spp., and Lactobacillus spp., in contrast with normal control. Metformin and montelukast, in combination with Lactobacillus, significantly reversed the testicular and liver damage caused by STZ.

Continuous low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis (CAP) is the standard of care for children with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), in order to prevent recurrent urinary tract infections. We aimed to assess short-term GM modifications induced by CAP in infants. Methods: We analyzed the GM structure in 87 infants (aged 1-5 months) with high-grade VUR, previously exposed or naïve to CAP. Microbial DNA was extracted from stool samples. GM profiling was achieved by 16S rRNA gene-based next-generation sequencing. Fecal levels of short- and branched-chain fatty acids were also assessed. Results: 36/87 patients had been taking daily CAP for a median time of 47 days, while 51/87 had not. In all patients, the GM was predominantly composed by Bifidobacteriaceae and Enterobacteriaceae. Subgroup comparative analysis revealed alterations in the GM composition of CAP-exposed infants at phylum, family and genus level. CAP-exposed GM was enriched in members of Enterobacteriaceae and Bacteroidetes, especially in the genera Bacteroides and Parabacteroides, and showed a trend toward increased Klebsiella, often associated with antibiotic resistance. In contrast, the GM of non-CAP children was mostly enriched in Bifidobacterium. No differences were found in fatty acid levels. Conclusions: In infants with VUR, even a short exposure to CAP definitely alters the GM composition, with increased relative abundance of opportunistic pathogens and decreased proportions of health-promoting taxa. Early low-dose antibiotic exposure might bear potential long-term clinical risks. © Copyright © 2021 Morello, D'Amico, Serafinelli, Turroni, Abati, Fiori, Baskin, Yalcinkaya, Jankauskiene, Pennesi, Zurowska, Becherucci, Drozdz, Mekahli, Krzemien, La Scola, Taranta-Janusz, Mehls, Schaefer, Candela and Montini.",2.0

However, the vast majority of rRNA amplicon-based studies reported the conspicuous intercohort and interindividual variation for the prevalence of Bifidobacterium in breast milk. In order to elucidate whether Bifidobacterium phylotypes persistently co-occured at the species or strain level in mother–breast milk–infant triads, we analyzed collectively the next-generation sequencing (NGS) datasets of bacterial 16S rRNA gene and the Bifidobacterium-specific groEL gene from maternal feces, breast milk, and infant feces in a small yet very homogeneous cohort of 25 healthy Uyghur mother–infant pairs (lactation for 7–720 days) in Kashgar, Xinjiang, China. Overall, 16S rRNA gene analysis showed that microbiome in the newborn gut was closer to that of breast milk in the first 4 months of lactation, and subsequently showed an obvious trend of adulthood at 6–12 months. Based on the BLAST accurate taxonomic result of the representative sequences of all ASVs (amplicon sequencing variants), only three sets of ASVs could be clearly assigned into Bifidobacterium species, whereas the remaining eight sets of ASVs corresponded to four indefinite Bifidobacterium species group. By contrast, the groEL gene dataset was partitioned into 376 ASVs, at least belonging to 13 well-known Bifidobacterium species or subspecies, of which 15 ASVs, annotated to seven well-known Bifidobacterium species or subspecies, showed triadic synchronism in most 23 mother–infant pairs tested. However, several other rare bifidobacterial phylotypes, which were frequently encountered in animals, were found to display no correspondence of the presence between the three ecosystems of mother–infant pairs. Our test results were obviously to support the hypothesis that breast milk acts as an intermediary for the transfer of probiotic commensal bacteria from mother to infant, especially for endosymbiotic Bifidobacterium that can colonize the infant gut. Some oxygen-insensitive exogenous Bifidobacterium phylotypes with a cosmopolitan lifestyle may be indirectly transferred to breast milk and the infant’s intestinal tract through environmental contamination. Thus, the groEL gene proved to be a very effective target for the depth resolution of Bifidobacterium community by high-throughput sequencing technologies. © Copyright © 2021 Yan, Luo, Zhang, Ni and Tian.",2.0

Here, we determined the effect of a nutritionally balanced diet rich in vegetables and whole grains alone and/or in combination with probiotics on the gut microbiota of healthy adults. We conducted a parallel-group randomized trial enrolling 63 healthy participants who were administered either a balanced diet (B-diet group), a probiotic capsule containing Lactobacillus plantarum PMO 08 (probiotics group), or a balanced diet plus probiotic capsule (synbiotics group) once daily for 2 weeks. The gut microbiota of each participant was analyzed via 16S ribosomal RNA MiSeq-based sequencing. Gastrointestinal symptoms and defecation habits were evaluated using questionnaires. The B-diet group showed significantly reduced Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio (P<0.05) and abundances of the genera Blautia (P<0.01), Dorea (P<0.05), and Lachnoclostridium (P< 0.05). Furthermore, the abundance of Bacteroides increased (P<0.05) compared to baseline levels. In the synbiotics group, Lactobacillus abundance increased significantly (P<0.05) and defecation difficulty decreased (P<0.05), confirming a synergistic effect of combined intake. All groups showed a significant reduction in the abundance of Clostridiaceae (P<0.001) and alleviation of bloating symptoms (P<0.05). Moreover, the relative abundance of Faecalibacterium significantly increased in the probiotics group (P<0.05). Therefore, the individual or combined intake of a nutritionally balanced diet and L. plantarum PMO 08 beneficially modifies the gut microbiota with the potential to alleviate gastrointestinal symptoms and improve defecation habits.

Here, 32 rats were divided into four groups, gavaged with L. acidophilus LA14 (3-109 CFU) or phosphate-buffered saline for 7 days, and then intraperitoneally injected with D-galactosamine or saline. After 24 h, blood, liver, ileum, and feces samples were collected for liver injury, inflammation, intestinal barrier, gut microbiota, metabolome, and transcriptome analyses. Pretreatment with L. acidophilus LA14 alleviated the D-galactosamineinduced elevation of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and bile acids; mitigated the histological injury to the liver and gut; and suppressed the inflammatory cytokines macrophage inflammatory protein 1α (MIP-1α), MIP-3α, and MCP-1. L. acidophilus LA14 also ameliorated the D-galactosamine- induced dysbiosis of the gut microbiota and metabolism, such as the enrichment of Bacteroides sp. strain dnLKV3 and the depletion of Streptococcus, butanoic acid, and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. The underlying mechanism of L. acidophilus LA14 included prevention of not only the D-galactosamine-induced upregulation of infectionand tumor-related pathways but also the D-galactosamine-induced downregulation of antioxidation-related pathways during this process, as reflected by the liver transcriptome and proteome analyses. Furthermore, the administration of L. acidophilus LA14 to healthy rats did not alter the tested liver indicators but significantly enriched the beneficial Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species, promoted metabolism and regulated pathways to improve immunity. The ability of L. acidophilus LA14 to alleviate liver injury was further confirmed with an acetaminophen-induced mouse model. These results might provide a reference for future studies on the application of L. acidophilus LA14 for the prevention of liver injury. © 2021 Lv et al.",3.0

We conducted a pilot interventional study on 60 adults with ≥ 1 risk factors for MS, of whom 33 consumed SA‐derived fresh foods and 27 received probiotics over 30 days, with a 15‐day follow‐up. Stool, urine and blood were collected over time to explore changes in gut microbiota, metabolome, and biochemical, inflammatory and immunologic parameters; previous dietary habits were investigated through a validated food‐frequency questionnaire. The baseline microbiota showed alterations typical of metabolic disorders, mainly an increase in Coriobacteriaceae and a decrease in health-associated taxa, which were partly reversed after the SA‐based diet. Improvements were observed in metabolome, MS presence (two out of six subjects no longer had MS) or components. Changes were more pronounced with less healthy baseline diets. Probiotics had a marginal, not entirely fa-vorable, effect, although one out of three subjects no longer suffered from MS. These findings sug-gest that improved dietary patterns can modulate the host microbiota and metabolome, counteract-ing the risk of developing MS. © 2021 by the authors.

NAFLD is currently the number one cause of chronic liver disease worldwide. The pathophysiology of NAFLD and disease progression is poorly understood. A potential contributing role for gut microbiome and metabolites in NAFLD is proposed. Currently, bariatric surgery is an effective therapy to prevent the progression of NAFLD and other manifestations of metabolic syndrome such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. This review provides an overview of gut microbiome composition and related metabolites in individuals with NAFLD and after bariatric surgery. Causality remains to be proven. Furthermore, the clinical effects of bariatric surgery on NAFLD are illustrated. Whether the gut microbiome and metabolites contribute to the metabolic improvement and improvement of NAFLD seen after bariatric surgery has not yet been proven. Future microbiome and metabolome research is necessary for elucidating the pathophysiology and underlying metabolic pathways and phenotypes and providing better methods for diagnostics, prognostics and surveillance to optimize clinical care. © 2021 by the authors.

"Lee S., You H., Lee M., Kim D., Jung S., Park Y., Hyun S.",Different reactions in each enterotype depending on the intake of probiotic yogurt powder,2021,Microorganisms,10.3390/microorganisms9061277,"Probiotics can be used as a nutritional strategy to improve gut homeostasis. We aimed to evaluate the intestinal microbiota profile of 18 subjects after ingestion of probiotic yogurt powder (PYP) based on enterotype. The subjects were classified into three enterotypes according to their microbial community: Bacteroides (n = 9, type B), Prevotella (n = 3, type P), and Ruminococcus (n = 6, type R). We performed controlled termination in a transient series that included a control period of three weeks before probiotic intake, PYP intake for three weeks, and a three‐week washout period. Fecal microbiota composition was analyzed by sequencing the V3–V4 super variable region of 16S rRNA. Based on the Bristol stool shape scale, abnormal stool shape improved with PYP intake, and bowel movements were activated. The abundance of Faecalibacterium, Eggerthella, and Leuconostoc, which ferment and metabolize glucose, showed a strong correlation with type B Bacteroides, and glucose metabolism improvement was observed in all type B subjects. Alkaline phosphatase was significantly improved only in type B. In addition, the abundance of type B Bacteroides showed a negative correlation with that of Lactobacillus. The abundance of Streptococcus, Agathobacter, and Christensenella, which are involved in lipid metabolism, showed a strong correlation with that of type P Prevotella, and triglyceride metabolism improvement was observed in all type P subjects. The gut microbiota showed only short‐term changes after PYP intake and showed resilience by returning to its original state when PYP intake was interrupted. In summary, the different responses to PYP intake may result from the different enterotypes and associated strains; therefore, the probiotic composition should be adjusted based on the individual enterotype. © 2021 by the authors.

Feeding Limosilactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 (LR 17938, LR) to SF mice reprograms the gut microbiota, reduces disease progression, and prolongs lifespan. However, the efficacy and mechanism of LR, compared with other probiotics, in producing these effects is unknown. We compared LR with Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG), an extensively investigated probiotic. LR was more effective than LGG in prolonging survival. Both probiotics restored the fecal microbial alpha diversity, but they produced distinct fecal bacterial clusters and differentially modulated microbial relative abundance (RA). LR increased the RA of phylum_Firmicutes, genus_Oscillospira whereas LR reduced phylum_Bacteroidetes, genus_Bacteroides and genus_Parabacteroides, reversing changes attributed to the SF phenotype. LGG primarily reduced the RA of genus_Bacteroides. Both LR and LGG reduced the potentially pathogenic taxon class_cproteobacteria. Plasma metabolomics revealed substantial differences among 696 metabolites. We observed similar changes of many clusters of metabolites in SF mice associated with treatment with either LR or LGG. However, a unique effect of LR was to increase the abundance of plasma adenosine metabolites such as inosine, which we previously showed had immune modulatory effects. In conclusion: 1) different probiotics produce distinct signatures in the fecal microbial community in mice with Treg deficiency; and 2) when comparing different probiotics, there are strain-specific microbial products with different anti-inflammatory properties, reinforcing the concept that ""one size does not fit all"" in the treatment of autoimmune disease. © 2021 American Physiological Society.

The treatment usually causes peritoneal dialysis–related peritonitis (PDRP), a common complication of PD that can lead to inadequate dialysis, gastrointestinal dysfunction, and even death. Recent studies indicated that Fushen Granule (FSG), a Chinese herbal formula, improves the treatment of PD. However, the mechanism of how FSG plays its role in the improvement is still unclear. Gut microbiota has been closely related to the development of various diseases. We carried out a randomized controlled trial to assess whether FSG can modulate the gut microbiota during PDRP treatment. Methods: Forty-two PDRP patients were recruited into the clinical trial, and they were randomly divided into control(CON), probiotics(PRO) or Fushen granule group(FSG). To check whether FSG improve the PD treatment, we assessed the clinical parameters, including albumin(ALB), hemoglobin(HGB), blood urea nitrogen(BUN) and creatinine(CR). Fecal samples were collected before hospitalization and discharge, and stored at -80°C within 1 hour. And we assessed the microbial population and function by applying the 16S rRNA gene sequencing and functional enrichment analysis. Results: Compared to control group, ALB is improved in both probiotics and FSG groups, while HGB is increased but BUN and CR is reduced in FSG group. Sequencing of 16S rRNA genes revealed that FSG and PRO affected the composition of the microbial community. FSG significantly increased a abundant represented by Bacteroides, Megamonas and Rothia, which was significantly correlated with the improvements in carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that FSG ameliorates the nutritional status and improves the quality of life by enriching beneficial bacteria associated with metabolism. These results indicate that FSG as alternative medicine is a promising treatment for patients with PDRP. © 2021",

However, this bacterium is extremely oxygen sensitive, which limits its industrial application as a probiotic. The use of prebiotics to increase the abundance of this bacterium in the gut is an alternative strategy to achieve its possible health-promoting effect. We evaluated nine substances as candidate prebiotics for F. prausnitzii using a pH-controlled single-batch fermenter as a human gut microbiota model. Of them, alginate markedly increased the relative abundance of F. prausnitzii, as determined by the significant increase in the number of 16S rRNA sequences corresponding to this bacterial taxon in the fecal fermentation samples detected by real-time PCR. However, F. prausnitzii strains were incapable of utilizing alginate in monoculture, implying that an interaction with another gut microbe was required. There was a positive correlation between the relative abundance of F. prausnitzii and that of Bacteroides when cultured in medium containing alginate as the sole carbon source, indicative of cross-feeding between these bacteria. Interestingly, the ratio of acetic acid, a known substrate for F. prausnitzii, produced by Bacteroides was significantly higher in the alginate-containing medium than in media containing other prebiotic candidates. Bacterially degraded alginate oligosaccharides (AOS) remained in the medium after Bacteroides monoculture, and an isolate of F. prausnitzii was able to utilize a portion of them. Genomic sequencing revealed that the strain that consumed the AOS contained an ATP-binding cassette transporter, an alginate lyase, and AlgQ1/2 homologs encoding solute-binding proteins. Furthermore, in real-time PCR analyses, AlgQ1/2 homologs were detected in fecal samples collected from 309 of 452 (68.4%) Japanese subjects. Thus, the products of alginate assimilation by Bacteroides may promote the growth of F. prausnitzii. © 2021 The Authors",3.0

Here, we made a comparison in As relative bioavailability (RBA) estimates for a contaminated soil (3913 mg As kg−1) using a mouse model with and without penicillin perturbing gut microbiota and metabolites. Compared to soil exposure alone (2% w/w soil in diets), addition of penicillin (100 or 1000 mg kg−1) reduced probiotic Lactobacillus and sulfate-reducing bacteria Desulfovibrio, enriched penicillin-resistant Enterobacter and Bacteroides, and decreased amino acid concentrations in ileum. With perturbed gut microbiota and metabolic profile, penicillin and soil co-exposed mice accumulated 2.81–3.81-fold less As in kidneys, excreted 1.02–1.35-fold less As in urine, and showed lower As-RBA (25.7–29.0%) compared to mice receiving diets amended with soil alone (56 ± 9.63%). One mechanism accounted for this is the decreased concentrations of amino acids arising from the gut microbiota shift which resulted in elevated iron (Fe) and As co-precipitation, leading to reduced As solubilization in the intestine. Another mechanism was conversion of bioavailable inorganic As to less bioavailable monomethylarsonic acid (MMAV) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMAV) by the antibiotic perturbed microflora. Based on in vivo mouse model, we demonstrated the important role of gut microbiota and gut metabolites in participating soil As solubilization and speciation transformation then affecting As oral bioavailability. Results are useful to better understand the role of gut bacteria in affecting As metabolism and the health risks of As-contaminated soils. © 2021 The Author(s)",4.0

This study aimed to identify a microbial signature with clinical significance of diagnosing LSTs and predicting adenoma recurrence after LSTs colectomy. Methods: We performed 16S rRNA sequencing in 24 mucosal samples, including 5 healthy controls (HC), 8 colorectal adenoma (CRA) patients, and 11 LST patients. The differentiating microbiota in fecal samples was quantified by qPCR in 475 cases with 113 HC, 208 CRA patients, 109 LST patients, and 45 colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. We identified differentially abundant taxa among cases and controls using linear discriminant analysis effect size analysis. ROC curve was used to evaluate diagnostic values of the bacterial candidates. Pairwise comparison of AUCs was performed by using the Delong’s test. The Mantel-Haenszel hazard models were performed to determine the effects of microbial compositions on recurrence free survival. Results: The microbial dysbiosis of LST was characterized by relative high abundance of the genus Lactobacillus-Streptococcus and the species enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF)–Peptostreptococcus stomatis (P. stomatis)–Parvimonas micra (P. micra). The abundance of ETBF, P. stomatis, and P. micra were steadily increasing in LST and CRC groups. P. stomatis behaved stronger value on diagnosing LST than the other two bacteria (AUC 0.887, 95% CI 0.842–0.931). The combination of P. stomatis, P. micra, and ETBF (AUC 0.922, 95% CI 0.887–0.958) revealed strongest diagnostic power with 88.7% sensitivity and 81.4% specificity. ETBF, P. stomatis, and P. micra were associated with malignant LST (PP.stomatis = 0.0015, PP.micra = 0.0255, PETBF = 0.0169) and the abundance of IL-6. The high abundance of P. stomatis was related to the adenoma recurrence after LST resection (HR = 3.88, P = 0.008). Conclusions: Fecal microbiome signature (ETBF–P. stomatis–P. micra) can diagnose LSTs with high accuracy. ETBF, P. stomatis, and P. micra were related to malignant LST and P. stomatis exhibited high predictive value on the adenoma recurrence after resection of LSTs. The fecal microbiome signature of LST may provide a noninvasive alternative to early detect LST and predict the adenoma recurrence risk after resections of LSTs. © Copyright © 2021 Shen, Li, Li, Zhang, Li, Cui, Gao, Chen, Chen and Fang.",

Methods: 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to compare the microbial composition of feces. The first sample was collected within 48 h after birth, then once per week until the NEC diagnosis, and finally 1–2 weeks after treatment or 28 days after birth. Results: The alpha diversity of the microbiota in the NEC group was higher than that in the control group. Beta diversity analysis showed that the control group had a higher similarity at the onset of NEC, while the NEC group was distributed in subgroups. Linear discriminant analysis effect size and taxonomic composition analyses indicated that the abundance of Bacteroides and Actinobacteria in NEC infants at birth was much higher than that in the control group, and this trend continued until NEC occurred. At this time, Rhizobiales, Dysgonomonas, Ochrobactrum, Ralstonia, Pelomonas, Acinetobacter, etc., were also more abundant in NEC infants. The upregulated different metabolic pathways in the NEC group were mainly concentrated on degradation/utilization/assimilation, biosynthesis, and generation of precursor metabolites and energy. Conclusions: 1. The microbial community differs according to the time of NEC diagnosis (bounded by 20 days). 2. No single microorganism is related to NEC, and the combined effect of multiple species is of great significance in the occurrence of NEC. Premature infants are easily affected by bacteria living in the environment, and compared with ordinary premature infants, NEC infants have a higher abundance of waterborne bacteria. Therefore, attention should be paid to the contamination of water sources and various ventilator pipelines for premature infants hospitalized in the neonatal intensive care unit. 3. An in-depth study of the mode of microbial colonization in premature infants combined with the different functions of various metabolic pathways involved in different microorganisms may be able to identify the cause of NEC. © Copyright © 2021 Fu, Li, Jiang, Hu and Wu.",

A multi-strain probiotics alone (loperamide-induced group with multi-strain probiotics mixture group; Lop-Pro) and a mixture of multi-strain probiotics and prebiotics (loperamide-induced group with multi-strain probiotics and prebiotics mixture group; Lop-Pro/Pre) were administered orally after inducing constipation. The fecal water content was significantly higher (by 42%) in the Lop-Pro/Pre group (33.5%) than in the loperamide-induced group (Lop) (23.7%) (p<0.05). The intestinal mucosal thickness, crypt cell area, and interstitial cells of Cajal area were significantly higher in the Lop-Pro/Pre group compared to the Lop group by 16.4%, 20.6%, and 42.3%, respectively. Additionally, the total short-chain fatty acid content was significantly increased in the Lop-Pro and Lop-Pro/Pre groups by 56.4% and 54.2%, respectively, compared with the Lop group. The Lop-Pro and Lop-Pro/Pre groups recovered loperamide-induced alteration in Bacteroidetes and Verrucomicrobia abundance among intestinal microbiota, whereas the Lop-Pro/Pre group recovered Akkermansia, Lactobacillus, Clostridium, Bacteroides, and Oscillibacter abundance. Moreover, the relative abundance of Oscillibacter and Clostridium was significantly different in the Lop-Pro/Pre group compared to the Lop group.

Conventional therapeutic approaches include dietary intervention, pharmacological treatment and probiotic supplements. The patient response can be highly variable and the interventions are often not resolutive. Moreover, the therapeutic strategy is usually planned (and gradually cor-rected) based on the patient’s response to empirical treatment, with few indirect gut health indicators useful to drive clinicians’ decisions. The ever-diminishing cost of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) allows clinicians to directly follow and characterise the evolution of the whole gut microbial community in order to highlight possible weaknesses. In this framework, faecal microbiome transplantation (FMT) is emerging as a feasible solution to CE, based on the implant of a balanced, eubiotic microbial community from a healthy donor to a dysbiotic patient. In this study, we report the promising results of FMT carried out in a 9-year-old dog suffering from CE for the last 3 years. The patient underwent a two-cycle oral treatment of FMT and the microbiota evolution was monitored by 16S rRNA gene sequencing both prior to FMT and after the two administrations. We evaluated the variation of microbial composition by calculating three different alpha diversity indices and compared the patient and donor data to a healthy control population of 94 dogs. After FMT, the patient’s microbiome and clinical parameters gradually shifted to values similar to those observed in healthy dogs. Symptoms disappeared during a follow-up period of six months after the second FMT. We believe that this study opens the door for potential applications of FMT in clinical veterinary practice and highlights the need to improve our knowledge on this relevant topic. © 2021 by the authors.

In this study, we used a metabolomic and 16S rRNA gene sequencing approach to evaluate effects of Bs29874 in the broiler intestine. Nicotinic acid and hypoxanthine were key metabolites that were produced by the strain in vitro and were also found in vivo to be increased in small intestinal content of broilers fed Bs29784 as dietary additive. Both metabolites have well-described anti-inflammatory effects in the intestine. Furthermore, Bs29784 supplementation to the feed significantly altered the ileal microbiome of 13-day-old broilers, thereby increasing the abundance of genus Bacillus, while decreasing genera and OTUs belonging to the Lactobacillaceae and Enterobacteriacae families. Moreover, Bs29784 did not change the cecal microbial community structure, but specifically enriched members of the family Clostridiales VadinBB60, as well as the butyrate-producing families Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae. The abundance of various OTUs and genera belonging to these families was significantly associated with nicotinic acid levels in the cecum, suggesting a possible cross-feeding between B. subtilis strain 29784 and these beneficial microbes. Taken together, the data indicate that Bs29784 exerts its described probiotic effects through a combined action of its metabolites on both the host and its microbiome. © 2021 by the authors.

Intestinal flora plays an important role in the progression of acute pancreatitis (AP). However, pathogenetic association between gut microbiota and HTGAP remains unknown. In this study, we enrolled 30 HTGAP patients and 30 patients with AP that is evoked by other causes. The V3–V4 regions of 16S rRNA sequences of the gut microbiota were analyzed. Clinical characteristics, microbial diversity, taxonomic profile, microbiome composition, microbiological phenotype, and functional pathways were compared between the two groups. Our results showed that the HTGAP group had a higher proportion of severe AP (46.7% vs. 20.0%), organ failure (56.7% vs. 30.0%), and a longer hospital stay (18.0 days vs. 6.5 days). HTGAP group also had poorer microbial diversity, higher abundances of Escherichia/Shigella and Enterococcus, but lower abundances of Dorea longicatena, Blautia wexlerae, and Bacteroides ovatus as compared with non-HTGAP group. Correlation analysis revealed that gut bacterial taxonomic and functional changes were linked with local and systemic complications, ICU admission, and mortality.

They are considered as a biomarker for dairy intake because fermentation in ruminants yields high amounts of propionate, which is used as the primer for lipogenesis. Recently, we demon-strated endogenous OCFA synthesis from propionate in humans and mice, but how this is affected by microbial colonization is still unexplored. Here, we investigated the effect of increasing microbiota complexity on hepatic lipid metabolism and OCFA levels in different dietary settings. Germ-free (GF), gnotobiotic (SIH, simplified human microbiota) or conventional (CONV) C3H/HeOuJ-mice were fed a CHOW or high-fat diet with inulin (HFI) to induce microbial fermentation. We found that hepatic lipogenesis was increased with increasing microbiota complexity, independently of diet. In contrast, OCFA formation was affected by diet as well as microbiota. On CHOW, hepatic OCFA and intestinal gluconeogenesis decreased with increasing microbiota complexity (GF > SIH > CONV), while cecal propionate showed a negative correlation with hepatic OCFA. On HFI, OCFA levels were highest in SIH and positively correlated with cecal propionate. The propionate content in the CHOW diet was 10 times higher than that of HFI. We conclude that bacterial propionate production affects hepatic OCFA formation, unless this effect is masked by dietary propionate intake. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",

Stool samples were used for 16S sequencing and real-time PCR. Serum was used for cytokine determination by flow cytometry, and zonulin quantification by ELISA. Pearson’s chi-square, Mann–Whitney, and Spearman’s correlation were used for statistical analyses. We detected differences in dietary habits, as well as in the gut microbiota in RRMS patients, with predominance of Akkermansia muciniphila and Bacteroides vulgatus and decreased Bifidobacterium. Interleukin-6 concentrations were decreased in treated patients, and we detected an increased intestinal permeability in RRMS patients when compared with controls. We conclude that diet plays an important role in the composition of the gut microbiota, and intestinal dysbiosis, detected in RRMS patients could be involved in increased intestinal permeability and affect the clinical response to DTMs. The future goal is to predict therapeutic responses based on individual microbiome analyses (personalized medicine) and propose dietary interventions and the use of probiotics or other microbiota modulators as adjuvant therapy to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of DMTs. © 2021 by the authors.

A bidirectional micro-organism-immune cell cross talks exists. Gut Bacteroides fragilis-T-cell crosstalk maintains innate immune cell/pathogen homeostasis. Commensal gut Clostridia spp. suppress inflammation and induce gut tolerance. Probiotics are administered to restore immune microbiome homeostasis. Individual microbial components have an immunomodulatory effect. However, probiotic therapies for sepsis-induced immune disruptions are rarely tailored to specific immune responses. Thus, we ask the question as to how components of the intestinal microbiome, often found in probiotic therapies, affect lymphocyte phenotypic profile? Methods: T-lymphocytes were cultured with either monomicrobial or polymicrobial combinations. Microbes used were Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, or Lactobacillus acidophilus. Cytokines, measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-included interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, IL-22, and IL-33. Flow cytometry was used for T-cell phenotyping for program-death receptor-1 (PD-1) and B- and T-lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA). T-cell DNA was extracted to assess global epigenetic changes. For translation, IL-33 was measured from surgical intensive care unit (ICU) patients with sepsis with either monomicrobial or polymicrobial infection. Results: Lactobacillus consistently induced IL-22 and IL-33. Bacteroides fragilis induced IL-33 only under polymicrobial (pB) conditions. Within surgical ICU patients, IL-33 levels were higher in polymicrobial versus monomicrobial patients. PD-1+ expression was lowest with either monomicrobial Bacteroides fragilis or Bacteroides fragilis predominant polymicrobial context. Conversely Bacteroides fragilis exposure induced a distinct PD-1-high subpopulation. B- and T-lymphocyte attenuator-positive expression did not differ after individual microbes. Among polymicrobial conditions, Bacteroides fragilis predominant (pB) and Lactobacillus acidophilus predominant (pL) increased BTLA+ expression. DNA methylation was most increased in response to Clostridium perfringens in monomicrobial and in response to Bacteroides fragilis in polymicrobial conditions. Conclusion: Unique microbe/lymphocyte interactions occur. Bacteroides fragilis induced a T-cell phenotype consistent with potential long-term immune recovery.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the regulatory effects of three Lactobacillus strains, L. johnsonii, L. plantarum, and L. rhamnosus, on the intestinal flora of EHEC-infected mice. The initial weight and diarrhoea index of the mice were recorded. After 21 days, the faeces of the mice were subjected to 16S rDNA high-throughput sequencing. The diarrhoea index of mice treated with Lactobacillus improved, their body weight continued to rise, and their liver index gradually decreased. The α diversity analysis showed that the intestinal flora diversity and abundance were lower in mice infected with EHEC than in healthy mice. L. plantarum, L. johnsonii, and L. rhamnosus significantly improved the diversity of the flora species. In terms of flora composition, the three main phyla present were Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria. The abundance of these three phyla was reduced to 93.81% after infection and restored to over 96.30% after treatment. At the genus level, Lactobacillus reduced the abundance of Bacteroides, Helicobacter pylori, and Shigella, while increasing the abundance of butyric acid-producing bacteria and Lactobacillus. Finally, a heat map and non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis showed that the intestinal flora structures in the L. johnsonii, L. plantarum, and L. rhamnosus treatment groups were closest to those of healthy mice. In conclusion, L. johnsonii, L. plantarum, and L. rhamnosus regulated and improved the structure of intestinal flora and relieved diarrhoea caused by EHEC infection. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2.0

Different probiotics have demonstrated beneficial effects on this condition, increasing the interest in the development of probiotic treatments. Lactobacillus fermentum CECT5716 has shown anti-inflammatory effects and capacity to modulate microbiota composition in different experimental models. In this study, L. fermentum CECT5716 was evaluated in a model of high fat diet-induced obesity in mice. It exerts anti-obesity effects, associated with its anti-inflammatory properties and amelioration of endothelial dysfunction and gut dysbiosis. The probiotic restores Akkermansia sp. abundance and reduced Erysipelotrichi class and Clostridium spp presence as well as increased Bacteroides proportion. In conclusion, this probiotic represents a very interesting approach. Our findings describe, for the first time, the ability of this probiotic to ameliorate experimental obesity through microbiome modulation, affecting different bacteria that have been reported to play a key role in the pathogenesis of obesity. Therefore, this suggests a potential use of L. fermentum CECT5716 in clinical practice, also taking into account that probiotic treatments have demonstrated to be relatively safe and well tolerated. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",9.0

This study examined the effects of 2 probiotics (Prob) and a synbiotic (Synb) during a naturally occurring NE challenge. On the day of hatch, 1200 Cobb male broilers were randomly allocated to 5 groups (8 pens/treatment, 30 birds/pen) including 1) negative control (NC): corn-soybean meal diet; 2) positive control (PC): NC + 453 g Stafac20/907 kg feed; 3) Prob 1: NC + 453 g Prob 1/907 kg feed; 4) Prob 2: NC + 453 g Prob 2/907 kg feed; and 5) Synb: NC + 453 g Synb/907 kg feed. One day after placement, birds were challenged by a coccidia vaccine to induce NE. Feed intake and body weights were measured on day 8 (NE onset) and end of starter (day 14) and grower (28) periods. On day 8, the small intestines of 3 birds/pen were examined for NE lesions. Ileal mucosal scrapings from one bird/pen were collected on day 8 and day 28 to profile the microbiota using 16S rRNA sequencing. Data were analyzed in JMP or QIIME 2 and significance between treatments identified by LSD or linear discriminant analysis effect size (P < 0.05). The Synb group significantly lowered NE lesion scores on day 8 and reduced day 0-14 mortality by 50% compared with NC. FCR was significantly better in all the groups, whereas ADG was higher in PC, Synb, and Prob 2 groups compared with NC from day 0 to day 28. Lower lesion scores in the Synb group were accompanied by lower relative abundance of Alistipes, ASF356, Faecalibaculum, Lachnospiraceae UCG-001, Muribaculum, Oscillibacter, Parabacteroides, Rikenellaceae RC9 gut group, Ruminococcaceae UCG-014, and Ruminiclostridium 9 compared with NC on day 8. On day 28, relative abundance of Lactobacillus was lower, whereas abundance of Bacteroides, Barnesiella, Butyricicoccus, CHKCI001, Eisenbergiella, Eubacterium hallii group, Helicobacter, Ruminococcaceae UCG-005, Ruminococcus torques group, and Sellimonas was significantly higher in the NC birds than in the Synb and Prob 2 groups. Collectively, these data indicate that during a subclinical naturally occurring NE, supplementation of specific additives could be effective in reducing intestinal lesions and mortality, and improving performance potentially through developing a signature microbial profile in the intestinal mucosal layer. © 2021 The Authors",2.0

While fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an effective therapy for CDI, a number of challenges limit its application. Studies suggest that probiotics may be a promising alternative therapy. In the current study, we evaluated whether Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (B. thetaiotaomicron) would inhibit colonization of toxigenic BI/NAP1/027 C. difficile in a mouse model. We found that B. thetaiotaomicron administration decreased the copies of C. difficile and inhibited inflammation in the colon. 16S rRNA sequencing showed that B. thetaiotaomicron administration was associated with a significantly increased relative abundance of Bacteroidetes and decreased level of Proteobacteria, leading to the reversal of the effect of antibiotics treatment and C. difficile infection on microbiota. B. thetaiotaomicron administration was associated with increases in the concentrations of alpha-muricholic acid, beta-muricholic acid, 12 ketolithocholic acid, and deoxycholic acid which are known to inhibit the growth of C. difficile, as well as reductions in the level of taurocholic acid, which promotes germination of C. difficile. Altered profile of major high abundance bile acids by B. thetaiotaomicron administration was similar to that with FMT treatment. Based on these results, we proposed the concept of “the ratio of promotion/inhibition BAs” which would advance our understanding of the relation of C. difficile and BAs. © 2021",3.0

Since hot water pre-extraction is a cost-effective strategy for integrated biorefineries to partially fractionate hemicellulose and improve feedstock quality and performance for downstream operations, the approach was applied to process switchgrass (SG), hybrid poplar (HP), and southern pine (SP) biomass at 160°C for 60 min. As a result, different hemicellulose-rich fractions were generated and the chemical characterization studies showed that they were composed of 76–91% of glucan, xylan, galactan, arabinan, and mannan oligosaccharides. The hot water extracts also contained minor concentrations of monomeric sugars (≤18%), phenolic components (≤1%), and other degradation products (≤3%), but were tested for probiotic activity without any purification. When subjected to batch fermentations by individual cultures of Lactobacillus casei, Bifidobacterium bifidum, and Bacteroides fragilis, the hemicellulosic hydrolysates elicited varied responses. SG hydrolysates induced the highest cell count in L. casei at 8.6 log10 cells/ml, whereas the highest cell counts for B. fragilis and B. bifidum were obtained with southern pine (5.8 log10 cells/ml) and HP hydrolysates (6.4 log10 cells/ml), respectively. The observed differences were attributed to the preferential consumption of mannooligosaccharides in SP hydrolysates by B. fragilis. Lactobacillus casei preferentially consumed xylooligosaccharides in the switchgrass and southern pine hydrolysates, whereas B. bifidum consumed galactose in the hybrid poplar hydrolysates. Thus, this study (1) reveals the potential to produce prebiotic ingredients from biorefinery-relevant lignocellulosic biomass, and (2) demonstrates how the chemical composition of hemicellulose-derived sources could regulate the viability and selective proliferation of probiotic microorganisms. © Copyright © 2021 Rajan, D’Souza, Kim, Choi, Elder, Carrier and Labbé.",2.0

High antibiotic usage is especially common in children with developing microbiome. We hypothesized that dry Mare’s milk, which is rich in biologically active substances without containing live bacteria, could be used as a prebiotic in promoting microbial diversity following antibiotic treatment in children. The present pilot study aims to determine the impacts of dry Mare’s milk on the diversity of gut bacterial communities when administered during antibiotic treatment and throughout the subsequent recovery phase. Methods: Six children aged 4 to 5 years and diagnosed with bilateral bronchopneumonia were prescribed cephalosporin antibiotics. During the 60 days of the study, three children consumed dry Mare’s milk whereas the other three did not. Fecal samples were collected daily during antibiotic therapy and every 5 days after antibiotic therapy. Total DNA was isolated and taxonomic composition of gut microbiota was analyzed by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. To assess the immune status of the gut, stool samples were analyzed by bead-based multiplex assays. Results: Mare’s milk treatment seems to prevent the bloom of Mollicutes, while preventing the loss of Coriobacteriales. Immunological analysis of the stool reveals an effect of Mare’s milk on local immune parameters under the present conditions. © Copyright © 2021 Kushugulova, Löber, Akpanova, Rysbekov, Kozhakhmetov, Khassenbekova, Essex, Nurgozhina, Nurgaziyev, Babenko, Markó and Forslund.",2.0

Inflammation, as reflected by C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations, significantly affects the metabolic ratio and trough concentrations of voriconazole. Bacteroides fragilis (B. fragilis) is an important component of the human intestinal microbiota. Clinical data have shown that B. fragilis abundance is comparatively higher in patients not presenting with adverse drug reactions, and inflammatory cytokine (IL-1β) levels are negatively correlated with B. fragilis abundance. B. fragilis natural product capsular polysaccharide A (PSA) prevents various inflammatory disorders. We tested the hypothesis that PSA ameliorates abnormal voriconazole metabolism by inhibiting inflammation. Germ-free animals were administered PSA intragastrically for 5 days after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. Their blood and liver tissues were collected to measure VRC concentrations. PSA administration dramatically improved the resolution phase of LPS-induced hepatic VRC metabolism and inflammatory factor secretion. It reversed inflammatory lesions and alleviated hepatic pro-inflammatory factor secretion. Both in vitro and in vivo data demonstrate that PSA reversed LPS-induced IL-1β secretion, downregulated the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway and upregulated CYP2C19 and P-gp. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to show that PSA from the probiotic B. fragilis ameliorates abnormal voriconazole metabolism by inhibiting TLR4-mediated NF-κB transcription and regulating drug metabolizing enzyme and transporter expression. Thus, PSA could serve as a clinical adjunct therapy. © Copyright © 2021 Wang, Ye, Xun, Mo, Tong, Ni, Huang, Liu, Zhan and Yang.",

However, the information about the symbiotic microbiota in the hepatopancreas of freshwater crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) is scarce. In this study, the high-throughput sequencing technology was used to characterize the bacterial communities in the hepatopancreas of P. clarkii at different health statuses, including healthy, anorexic, moribund, and whitish muscle statuses. Results showed that the hepatopancreatic microbiota of healthy crayfish was dominated by the phyla Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidota and Clostridium sensu stricto 11, Proteus, C. sensu stricto 1, Paraclostridium, and Weissella. Distinct differences were found in the structure, composition, and predicted function of the hepatopancreatic microbiota between the healthy and the sick crayfish. The LEfSe analysis revealed that the symbiotic bacterial species, including Proteus penneri, C. sensu stricto 11 and Lactococcus garvieae, and the potential probiotics, such as Weissella cibaria and Lactobacillus murinus, in the hepatopancreas of healthy crayfish were significantly enriched than those of sick crayfish, whereas the opportunistic pathogens, including Citrobacter freundii, Plesiomonas shigelloides, C. sensu stricto 7, and Terrisporobacter, in the hepatopancreas of sick crayfish were significantly enriched than those of healthy crayfish. In addition, compared with that of healthy crayfish, the hepatopancreas of moribund crayfish had significantly enriched bacterial genera, such as Dubosiella, Candidatus, Bacilloplasma, and Phreatobacter, whereas the hepatopancreas of crayfish with whitish muscle disease was observed with a significant enrichment of some opportunistic pathogens, including Morganella morganii, Providencia alcalifaciens, Vagococcus fluvialis, Clostridium lundense, and Bacteroides. This apparent dysbiosis, which showed the increase in opportunistic pathogens and the decrease in symbiotic microorganisms (including potential probiotics), might represent a specific microbial signature of disease occurrence. Furthermore, the PICRUSt2 analysis revealed that the microbial functions involved in carbohydrate metabolism and xenobiotic biodegradation in the hepatopancreas of sick crayfish were significantly enriched than those of healthy crayfish, whereas the microbial functions involved in amino acid metabolism, lipid biosynthesis, biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites, energy metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, transport and catabolism, and immune system in the hepatopancreas of healthy crayfish were significantly enriched compared with those of sick crayfish. This study revealed the hepatopancreatic microbiota dysbiosis associated with disease outbreaks, providing potential indicators for assessing the health status of crayfish and new clues for exploring the potential role of the hepatopancreatic microorganisms in affecting host health and disease. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",9.0

Probiotics can regulate the gut microbiota by inhibiting the colonization of harmful bacteria and promoting the proliferation of beneficial bacteria. Here, we investigated the preventive effects of a probiotic Bacillus licheniformis strain (BL, CMCC 63516) on HS rats as well as its effects on intestinal barrier function and gut microbiota. All rats were randomly divided into four groups: control (Con) + PBS (pre-administration with 1 ml PBS twice a day for 7 days, without HS induction), Con + BL group (pre-administration with 1 ml 1 × 108 CFU/ml BL twice a day for 7 days, without HS induction), HS + PBS (PBS, with HS induction), and HS + BL (BL, with HS induction). Before the study, the BL strain was identified by genomic DNA analysis. Experimental HS was induced by placing rats in a hot and humid chamber for 60 min until meeting the diagnostic criterion of HS onset. Body weight, core body temperature, survival rate, biochemical markers, inflammatory cytokines, and histopathology were investigated to evaluate the preventive effects of BL on HS. D-Lactate, I-FABP, endotoxin, and tight-junction proteins were investigated, and the fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (FD-4) test administered, to assess the degree of intestinal injury and integrity. Gut microbiota of rats in each group were analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing. The results showed that pre-administration with BL significantly attenuated hyperthermia, reduced HS-induced death, alleviated multiple-organ injury, and decreased the levels of serum inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, BL sustained the intestinal barrier integrity of HS rats by alleviating intestinal injury and improving tight junctions. We also found that BL significantly increased the ratios of two probiotic bacteria, Lactobacillus and Lactococcus. In addition, Romboutsia, a candidate biomarker for HS diagnosis, was unexpectedly detected. In summary, BL pre-administration for 7 days has preventative effects on HS that may be mediated by sustaining intestinal barrier function and modulating gut microbiota. © Copyright © 2021 Li, Wang, Chen, Xu, Wang, Xia, Liu, Wang, Xie, Wu, Li, Zhang, Wang, Zhu, Ling and Xu.",3.0

Our previous studies have shown that AS can alleviate early CKD through the “gut-kidney axis”, but the regulatory role of AS in the “gut-kidney axis” in the middle and late stages of CKD caused by cyclosporin A-induced chronic nephrotoxicity (CICN) has remained unclear. Aim of the study: To explore the protective effect of AS by regulating the intestinal flora to further control the miRNA-mRNA interaction profiles in CICN. Materials and methods: Thirty-two mice were divided into four groups: Normal (N) (olive oil), Model (M) (CsA, 30 mg kg−1 d−1), AS (CsA + AS, 30 + 8.4 g kg−1 d−1) and FMT-AS (CsA + Faeces of AS group, 30 mg + 10 mL kg−1 d−1). The mice were treated for 6 weeks. Changes in renal function related metabolites were detected, pathological changes in the colon and kidney were observed, and 16S rDNA sequencing was performed on mouse faeces. In addition, miRNA and mRNA sequencing were performed on the kidney to construct differential expression (DE) profiles of the other 3 groups compared with group M. The target mRNAs among the DE miRNAs were then predicted, and an integrated analysis was performed with the DE mRNAs to annotate gene function by KEGG. DE miRNAs and DE mRNAs related to CICN in the overlapping top 20 KEGG pathways were screened and verified. Results: Eight metabolites that could worsen renal function were increased in group M, accompanied by thickening of the glomerular basement membrane, vacuolar degeneration of renal tubules, and proliferation of collagen fibres, while AS and FMT-AS intervention amended these changes to varying degrees. Simultaneously, intestinal permeability increased, the abundance and diversity of the flora decreased, and the ratio of Firmicum to Bacteroides (F/B) increased in group M. The AS and FMT-AS treatments reversed the flora disorder and increased probiotics producing butyric acid and lactic acid, especially Akkermansia and Lactobacillus, which might regulate the 12 overlapping top 20 KEGG pathways, such as Butanoate metabolism, Tryptophan metabolism and several RF-related pathways, leading to the remission of renal metabolism. Finally, 15 DE miRNAs and 45 DE mRNAs were screened as the therapeutic targets, and the results coincided with the sequencing results. Conclusion: AS could alleviate renal fibrosis and metabolism caused by CICN through the “gut-kidney axis”. Probiotics such as Akkermansia and Lactobacillus were the primary driving factors, and the miRNA-mRNA interaction profiles, especially Butanoate metabolism and Tryptophan metabolism, may be an important subsequent response and regulatory mechanism. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",3.0

Microorganisms bowel has been suggested to be an important factor in weight loss following surgery to treat obesity. Because the treatment of obesity causes a different rearrangement of the digestive system, it is likely to have various impacts on microorganisms in the gastrointestinal tract. Through the present study, we made a comparison between the effects of surgical operations on the treatment of obesity on microorganisms in the intestine of obese people. The parameters were recorded human and clinical measurements before and after 12 months of treatment. The research involved a sample made up of 19 patients. Nine of them followed medically based treatments (MT), depending on low-concentrations diets, three-fold weekly mild physical exercise, and a physician’s 12-month monthly visit. Also, five patients were recruited with 5 trocar techniques as previously described to bypass RouxenY in the abdomen (RYGB) and 5 gastrectomies (SG). Five bacterial strains were obtained from the gastric flora of 10 patients before the bariatric surgery, while seven strains were isolated from the same patients after 12 months of surgery. all bacterial samples were morphologically and biochemically identified, followed by molecular fingerprinting identification via RAPD –PCR. Through the present study, we identified the effects of obesity treatment on intestinal microbes in humans. While no significant changes in weight, clinical signs, or microorganisms were observed from subjects on MT, the reduction of obesity processes caused significant changes in intestinal microbes, which are associated with some parameters of human measurements or metabolism.

The existing relevant studies focus on 16S rRNA gene sequencing, but in-depth research on gene functions and comprehensive identification of microbiota is lacking. Objectives: To comprehensively identify characteristic gut microbial compositions, genetic functions and relative metabolites of patients with psoriasis and to reveal the potential pathogenesis of psoriasis. Methods: DNA was extracted from the faecal microbiota of 30 psoriatic patients and 15 healthy subjects, and metagenomics sequencing and bioinformatic analyses were performed. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database, cluster of orthologous groups (COG) annotations, and metabolic analyses were used to indicate relative target genes and pathways to reveal the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Results: Compared with healthy individuals, the gut microbiota of psoriasis patients displayed an alteration in microbial taxa distribution, but no significant difference in microbial diversity. A distinct gut microbial composition in patients with psoriasis was observed, with an increased abundance of the phyla Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Verrucomicrobia and genera Faecalibacterium, Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Megamonas and Roseburia and a decreased abundance of the phyla Bacteroidetes, Euryarchaeota and Proteobacteria and genera Prevotella, Alistipes, and Eubacterium. A total of 134 COGs were predicted with functional analysis, and 15 KEGG pathways, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis, WNT signaling, apoptosis, bacterial secretion system, and phosphotransferase system, were significantly enriched in psoriasis patients. Five metabolites, hydrogen sulfide (H2S), isovalerate, isobutyrate, hyaluronan and hemicellulose, were significantly dysregulated in the psoriatic cohort. The dysbiosis of gut microbiota, enriched pathways and dysregulated metabolites are relevant to immune and inflammatory response, apoptosis, the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling pathway, gut-brain axis and brain-skin axis that play important roles in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Conclusions: A clear dysbiosis was displayed in the gut microbiota profile, genetic functions and relative metabolites of psoriasis patients.

Because of the limited effectiveness of these treat-ments, new strategies for recovery from AD lesions are continually being explored. In this article, we describe the gut microbiome changes achieved in a recently published clinical trial with the probiotic formulation Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis CECT 8145, Bifidobacterium longum CECT 7347, and Lacticaseibacillus casei CECT 9104 (formerly Lactobacillus casei CECT 9104), showing a significant improvement in SCORAD (scoring atopic dermatitis) index in children (4–17 years) with AD (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT02585986). The present gut microbiome post hoc study showed no significant changes in diversity (Shannon and Simpson indexes) after probiotic consumption. In the probiotic group, genera Bacteroides, Ruminococcus, and Bifidobacterium significantly increased their levels while Faecalibacterium decreased, compared to the placebo group. Faecalibacterium showed the highest presence and significant positive correlation with AD severity (SCORAD in-dex), whereas Abyssivirga, Bifidobacterium, and Lactococcus were inversely correlated. The results suggest that the consumption of the probiotic formulation here assayed modulates the gut microbi-ome with significant changes in genera Bacteroides and Faecalibacterium. In turn, the improvement in SCORAD correlates with a decrease in Faecalibacterium and an increase in Bifidobacterium, among others. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",2.0

Several studies have reported that fecal microbiome of neonatal calves is shifted by various factors such as diarrhea, antibiotic treatment, or environmental changes. Despite the importance of gut microbiome, a lack of knowledge regarding the composition and functions of microbiota impedes the development of new strategies for improving growth performance and disease resistance during the neonatal calf period. In this study, we utilized next-generation sequencing to monitor the time-dependent dynamics of the gut microbiota of dairy calves before weaning (1–8 weeks of age) and further investigated the microbiome changes caused by diarrhea. Metagenomic analysis revealed that continuous changes, including increasing gut microbiome diversity, occurred from 1 to 5 weeks of age. However, the composition and diversity of the fecal microbiome did not change after 6 weeks of age. The most prominent changes in the fecal microbiome composition caused by aging at family level were a decreased abundance of Bacteroidaceae and Enterobacteriaceae and an increased abundance of Prevotellaceae. Phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states (PICRUSt) analysis indicated that the abundance of microbial genes associated with various metabolic pathways changed with aging. All calves with diarrhea symptoms showed drastic microbiome changes and about a week later returned to the microbiome of pre-diarrheal stage regardless of age. At phylum level, abundance of Bacteroidetes was decreased (p = 0.09) and that of Proteobacteria increased (p = 0.07) during diarrhea.

This study aimed to verify if multiethnic dietary habits destabilised the gut mi-crobiome in response to frequent changes, leading to readily colonisation of exogenous microbes. This may have health implications. We profiled Singapore young adults of different ethnicities for dietary habits, faecal type, gut microbiome and cytokine levels. Subjects were challenged with Lactobacillus casei, and corresponding changes in microbiome and cytokines were evaluated. Here, we found that the majority of young adults had normal stool types (73% Bristol Scale Types 3 and 4) and faecal microbiome categorised into three clusters, irrespective of race and gender. Cluster 1 was dominated by Bacteroides, Cluster 2 by Prevotella, while Cluster 3 showed a marginal increase in Blautia, Ruminococaceae and Ruminococcus, without a predominant microbiota. These youngsters in the three faecal microbiome clusters preferred Western high sugary beverages, Southeast Asian plant-rich diet and Asian/Western diets in rotation, respectively. Multiethnic dietary habits (Cluster 3) led to a gut microbiome without predominant microbiota yet demonstrated colonisation resistance to Lactobacillus. Although Bacteroides and Prevotella are reported to be health-promoting but also risk factors for some illnesses, Singapore-style dietary rotation habits may alleviate Bacteroides and Prevotella associated ill effects. Different immunological outcome was observed during consumption of the lactobacilli among the three microbiome clusters. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",

A diet rich in unsaturated fatty acids has been reported to stimulate the growth of Bilophila wadsworthia by increasing the proportion of the sulfonated bile acid taurocholate (TC). The taurine-induced overgrowth of B. wadsworthia promoted the development of colitis in interleukin-10-deficient (IL-10-/-) mice. This study aimed to investigate whether intake of the sulfonates sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerols (SQDG) with a dietary supplement or their degradation product sulfoquinovose (SQ), stimulate the growth of B. wadsworthia in a similar manner and, thereby, cause intestinal inflammation. Conventional IL-10-/- mice were fed a diet supplemented with the SQDG-rich cyanobacterium Arthrospira platensis (Spirulina). SQ or TC were orally applied to conventional IL-10-/- mice and gnotobiotic IL-10-/- mice harboring a simplified human intestinal microbiota with or without B. wadsworthia. Analyses of inflammatory parameters revealed that none of the sulfonates induced severe colitis, but both, Spirulina and TC, induced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in cecal mucosa. Cell numbers of B. wadsworthia decreased almost two orders of magnitude by Spirulina feeding but slightly increased in gnotobiotic SQ and conventional TC mice. Changes in microbiota composition were observed in feces as a result of Spirulina or TC feeding in conventional mice. In conclusion, the dietary sulfonates SQDG and their metabolite SQ did not elicit bacteria-induced intestinal inflammation in IL-10-/- mice and, thus, do not promote colitis. © 2021 The Authors",2.0

Four treatments were performed with 312 male day-old Ross 308 reared in floor pens from day 0 to day 35: 2 groups fed control diet without or with NE challenge (CtrlNC and CtrlNE); 2 groups fed probiotic and antibiotic supplements in the control diet with NE challenge (ProNE and AntNE). Necrotic enteritis challenge procedures commenced with inoculation of Eimeria spp 1 mL/bird per os at day 9 and Clostridium perfringens EHE-NE18 (approximately 108 cfu/mL) 1 mL/bird per os at day 14 and day 15. Performance parameters were measured on day 16 and day 35. Lesion, cecal microbiota, and jejunal gene expression were analyzed on day 16. Necrotic enteritis challenge significantly suppressed the performance parameters compared with CtrlNC: 27% weight gain reduction, 11 points feed conversion ratio (FCR) increase at day 16, and 12% weight gain reduction, 5-point FCR increase at day 35. By day 35, ProNE and AntNE treatments enabled significantly higher weight gain (4 and 9%, respectively) than CtrlNE. Compared with CtlrNE and contrary to AntNE, ProNE treatment exhibited upregulation of genes coding for tight junctions proteins (CLDN1, JAM2, TJP1), cytokines (IL12, interferon gamma, TGFβ), and Toll-like receptors (TLR5, TLR21) suggesting enhanced immunity and intestinal integrity. 16S NGS analysis of cecal microbiota at day 16 showed a decreased alpha diversity in challenged groups. Principal component analysis of operational taxonomic unit (OTU) abundance revealed that ProNE and AntNE grouped closely while both distantly from CtrlNC and CtrlNE, which were separately grouped, indicating the similar effects of ProNE and AntNE on the OTU diversity that were however different from both CtrlNC and CtrlNE. Microbiota analysis revealed an increase of genera Faecalibacterium, Oscillospira, and Butyricicoccus; and a decrease of genera Ruminococcus, Lactobacillus, and Bacteroides; and an increase of the Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio in ProNE and AntNE groups compared with the CtlrNE group. It is concluded that Bs 29,784 may enable improved health of broiler chickens under NE conditions thus performance implications. © 2021",6.0

We aimed to comprehensively (i) identify diet-microbiota associations in adults with IBS consuming habitual diet; (ii) assess the impact of two nutritional interventions on the microbiota; and (iii) determine whether baseline microbiota can predict clinical response to diet or probiotic intervention. Methods: Data were analyzed from 95 individuals with IBS participating in a previously published 4-week 2x2 factorial design randomized controlled trial investigating the impact of the low FODMAP diet (LFD) and co-administration of a probiotic. Diet was assessed at four hierarchical levels and partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to profile the microbiota. Results: There were numerous diet-microbiota associations especially at the nutrient level, including a negative association between protein and Bifidobacterium abundance (rs = −0.358, p &lt; 0.001). After correction for multiple testing, the significance for this association (q = 0.237) and all others was lost. Low FODMAP diet led to changes in abundance of major saccharolytic genera compared with sham diet, including higher Bacteroides (LFD 34.1% (15.7%) vs sham 23.3% (15.2%), q = 0.01) and lower Bifidobacterium (0.9% (1.0%) vs 2.1%, (2.5%) q = 0.029). Compared with placebo, probiotic supplementation led to higher Lactobacillus (probiotic 0.08% (0.1%) vs placebo 0.03% (0.2%), q &lt; 0.001), and Streptococcus abundance (2.0% (2.2%) vs 0.6% (1.2%), q = 0.001). The probiotic treatment buffered the impact of the low FODMAP diet on Bifidobacterium. Baseline microbiota did not predict clinical response to either intervention. Conclusions: Although diet modifies the gut microbiota, bivariate correlation analysis may only provide a limited explanation of the complex diet interactions with individual gut bacteria in IBS. Some diet interventions modify the microbiota in IBS.

Methods and Results: The ability of non-digested and digested AB or GB to stimulate the growth ad metabolism of Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-05, Lactobacillus casei L-26 and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12 was evaluated. Changes in populations of distinct bacterial groups of human colonic microbiota induced by digested AB and GB were evaluated using an in vitro colonic fermentation system. Non-digested and digested AB and GB favoured probiotic growth. No difference among counts of probiotics in media with glucose, fructooligosaccharides and non-digested and digested AB and GB was found during a 48-h cultivation. Cultivation of probiotics in media with non-digested and digested AB and GB resulted in decreased pH, increased organic acid production and sugar consumption over time. Digested AB and GB caused overall beneficial changes in abundance of Bifidobacterium spp., Lactobacillus–Enterococcus, Eubacterium rectall–Clostridium coccoides and Bacteroides–Provotella populations, besides to decrease the pH and increase the short-chain fatty acid production during a 24-h in vitro colonic fermentation. Conclusion: AB and GB could be novel prebiotic ingredients because they can stimulate the growth and metabolism of probiotics and induce overall beneficial changes in human colonic microbiota. Significance and Impact of the Study: AB and GB stimulated the growth and metabolism of probiotics, in addition to induce beneficial alterations in human colonic microbiota composition and increase short-chain fatty acid production. These results characterize AB and GB as potential prebiotic ingredients and fruit processing by-products as sources of added-value compounds. © 2020 The Society for Applied Microbiology",5.0

In this study, we show that aluminum (Al) exposure, even at low dose, affected the growth of representative strains from the human intestine via pure culture experiments. In vitro, Lactobacillus plantarum CCFM639 could bind Al on its cell surface as shown by electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray analysis. The potential of L. plantarum CCFM639 to reverse changes in human intestine microbiota induced by low-dose dietary Al exposure was investigated using an in vitro colonic fermentation model. Batch fermenters were inoculated with fresh stool samples from healthy adult donors and supplemented with 86 mg/L Al and/or 109 CFU of L. plantarum CCFM639. Al exposure significantly increased the relative abundances of Bacteroidetes (Prevotella), Proteobacteria (Escherichia), Actinobacteria (Collinsella), Euryarchaeota (Methanobrevibacter), and Verrucomicrobiaceae and decreased Firmicutes (Streptococcus, Roseburia, Ruminococcus, Dialister, Coprobacillus). Some changes were reversed by the inclusion of L. plantarum CCFM639. Alterations in gut microbiota induced by Al and L. plantarum CCFM639 inevitably led to changes in metabolite levels. The short-chain fatty acid (SCFAs) contents were reduced after Al exposure, but L. plantarum CCFM639 could elevate their levels. SCFAs had positive correlations with beneficial bacteria, such as Dialister, Streptococcus, Roseburia, and negative correlations with Erwinia, Escherichia, and Serratia. Therefore, dietary Al exposure altered the composition and structure of the human gut microbiota, and this was partially mitigated by L. plantarum CCFM639. This probiotic supplementation is potentially a promising and safe approach to alleviate the harmful effects of dietary Al exposure. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",3.0

Nevertheless, antibiotics are known to disrupt the hindgut microbiota, affecting the fibrolytic activity of bacteria and the intestinal immune balance, leading to diseases. This in vivo study used a general and comprehensive approach for characterizing the hindgut ecosystem of 9 healthy horses over 28 days in response to a 5-day challenge with oral trimethoprim-sulfadiazine (TMS), with a special emphasis on microbial fibrolytic activity and the host immune response. Horses were supplemented with two doses of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Ligilactobacillus salivarius (formerly L. salivarius), and Bifidobacterium lactis blend or a placebo in a 3 × 3 Latin square design. Changes in fecal microbiota were investigated using 16S rRNA sequencing. Clostridioides difficile was quantified in feces using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Anaerobic microbiological culture was used to enumerate functional bacterial groups (cellulolytic, amylolytic, and lactic acid-utilizing). The environmental dimensions were assessed by measuring the concentrations of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and lactic acid using biochemical methods, and changes in pH and dry matter weight. Systemic and local inflammation was evaluated by determination of cytokine and immunoglobulin (Ig)A concentrations in the serum and secretory IgA (SIgA) concentrations in the feces using immuno-enzymatic methods. Oral TMS treatment strongly altered the whole hindgut ecosystem by 2 days after the first administration. Bacterial diversity decreased in proportion to the relative abundance of fibrolytic genera, which coincided with the decrease in the concentration of cellulolytic bacteria. At the same time, the composition of microbiota members was reorganized in terms of relative abundances, probably to support the alteration in fibrolysis. C. difficile DNA was not found in these horses, but the relative abundances of several potential pathobiont genera increased. 2 days after the first TMS administration, fecal concentrations of VFAs and SIgA increased in parallel with fecal water content, suggesting an alteration of the integrity of the hindgut mucosa. Recovery in bacterial composition, functions, and immune biomarkers took 2–9 days after the end of TMS administration. Supplementation with this bacterial blend did not limit bacterial alteration but might have interesting mucosal immunomodulatory effects. © Copyright © 2021 Collinet, Grimm, Julliand and Julliand.",5.0

LPP supplementation mitigated DSS-induced breakage of the gut barrier as evidenced by the increased tight junction proteins and the enhanced integrity of epithelial cells. Both LPP and 5-ASA treatments could downregulate the expressions of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4), NOD protein-like receptor 3 (NLRP3), and proinflammatory cytokines to normal levels. Notably, treatment with LPP at a dosage of 500 mg/kg/day effectively upregulated FFAR2 and FFAR3 expression and contents of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), suggesting the activation of the SCFA-FFAR (free fatty acid receptor) pathway. Consistently, the abundances of probiotic taxa and microbiota (Akkermansia, Lactobacillus, Coprococcus, and Bacteroides uniformis) associated with SCFA synthesis were elevated, whereas harmful bacteria (Enterococcus and Aggregatibacter) were suppressed. These data indicate that LPP ameliorates gut barrier damage, activates the microbiota-SCFA-FFAR signaling cascade, and suppresses the TLR4/NLRP3-NF-κB pathway, and therefore, LPP supplementation could be a promising way to protect the intestinal tract. © 2021 American Chemical Society.",7.0

A number of studies demonstrated high levels of specificity and temporal stability of individual gut phageomes, as well as their specific alterations in disease cohorts, in parallel with changes in the bacteriome. It has been speculated that phages might have an active role in shaping the taxonomic composition and functional properties of the human gut bacteriome. An overwhelming majority of gut bacteriophages, however, remain uncultured, unclassified, and their specific hosts and infection strategies are still unknown. They are often referred to as “the viral dark matter”. A possible breakthrough in understanding of the phageome can only become possible when a significant proportion of the “the viral dark matter” is identified and linked to bacterial hosts. Here, we describe a method that enables rapid discovery and host-linking of novel bacteriophages in the gut via a combination of serial enrichment cultures and shotgun metagenomics of viral DNA. Using this approach dozens of novel and previously known bacteriophages were detected, including the ones infecting difficult-to-culture anaerobic bacteria. The majority of phages failed to produce lysis and propagate on host cultures in traditional assays. The newly identified phages include representatives of Siphoviridae, Myoviridae, Podoviridae, and crAss-like viruses, infecting diverse bacterial taxa of Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Verrucomicrobia and Proteobacteria phyla. The proposed new method has a potential for high-throughput screening applications for mass discovery of new phages in different environments. © Copyright © 2021 Fitzgerald, Shkoporov, Upadrasta, Khokhlova, Ross and Hill.",1.0

Changes in the composition of the intestinal microbiota, which can lead to an abnormal mucosal response, could be the missing link between these two diseases. Our study evaluate the composition of intestinal microbiota and to characterize gut dysbiosis in patients with IBD and AS. Methods: We conducted a prospective case-control study that enrolled 124 patients [20 Crohn’s disease (CD), 27 ulcerative colitis (UC), 28 AS, 17 IBD + AS and 32 controls). Intestinal microbiota analysis was performed by real-time polymerase chain reaction in stool samples. Results: The total quantity of bacteria was decreased in all investigated groups compared to the control group. In studied groups, we noticed an increased percentage of Bacteroides and Escherichia coli (E.coli) and a decreased percentage of Clostridium coccoides, Clostridium leptum, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii compared to the control group. The percentages of Bifidobacterium (p=0.010) as well as Lactobacillus group (p=0.023) were higher in the L3 form of CD patients. In the E2 form of UC, the quantity of Bacteroides was much higher compared to the E3 form (p=0.004). In AS patients, significant correlations were observed only for the Bifidobacterium species, significantly increased in the axial form compared to peripheral disease (p=0.035). Statistically significant correlations were demonstrated between the Crohn Disease Activity Index score and the total bacterial group (p=0.023, r=-0.507), respectively Bacteroides (p=0.021, r=-0.511) and between the Mayo score and Lactobacillus (p=0.001), respectively E. coli (p=0.001). In IBD + AS group, the Crohn Disease Activity Index score was inversely correlated with the total bacterial group (p=0.010) and directly correlated with Lactobacillus (p=0.047). Conclusions: Intestinal dysbiosis is associated with both IBD and AS. In the association of IBD with AS, dysbiosis is intermediate, but it is associated with the more severe articular disease. Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus (commonly used as probiotics!) were found to be increased in the association between active IBD and active AS. Further studies are needed to understand how dysbiosis regulates the gut immune system and contributes to intestinal and articular inflammation. © 2021, Romanian Society of Gastroenterology.

Therefore, the probiotic-based modifica-tion of the intestinal microbiota composition has been developed as a strategy for the treatment of obesity. In this study, we selected four Bifidobacterium adolescentis strains isolated from the feces of newborn and elderly humans to investigate whether supplementation with B. adolescentis of various origins could alleviate obesity in mice. Male C57BL/6J mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD, 60% energy as fat) received one of the following 14-week interventions: (i) B. adolescentis N4_N3, (ii) B. adolescentis Z25, (iii) B. adolescentis 17_3, (iv) B. adolescentis 2016_7_2, and (v) phosphate-buffered saline. The metabolic parameters, thermogenesis, and immunity of all treated mice were measured. Cecal and colonic microbial profiles were determined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Intestinal concentrations of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The B. adolescentis strains isolated from the feces of elderly humans (B. adolescentis Z25, 17_3, and 2016_7_2) decreased the body weight or weight gain of mice, whilst the strain isolated from the newborn (B. adolescentis N4_N3) increased the body weight of mice. The B. adolescentis strains isolated from the elderly also increased serum leptin concentrations and induced the expression of thermogenesis-and lipid metabolism-related genes in brown adipose tissue. All the B. adolescentis strains alleviated inflammations in the spleen and brain and modified the cecal and colonic microbiota. Particularly, all strains reversed the HFD-induced depletion of Bifidobacterium and reduced the development of beta-lactam resistance. In addition, the B. adolescentis strains isolated from the elderly increased the relative abundances of potentially beneficial genera, such as Bacteroides, Parabacteroides, and Faecalibaculum. We speculate that such increased abundance of commensal bacteria may have mediated the alleviation of obesity, as B. adolescentis supplementation decreased the intestinal production of SCFAs, thereby reducing energy delivery to the host mice. Our results revealed that certain strains of B. adolescentis can alleviate obesity and modify the gut microbi-ota of mice. The tested strains of B. adolescentis showed different effects on lipid metabolism and immunity regulation, with these effects related to whether they had been isolated from the feces of newborn or elderly humans. This indicates that B. adolescentis from different sources may have dis-parate effects on host health possibly due to the transmission of origin-specific functions to the host. © 2021 by the authors.

In this study, we collected fecal samples at Day-10 (D10) and 4-months corrected-age (4M) from 227 moderate–late preterm (MLPT) babies enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of nutritional management. A total of 320 samples underwent 16S amplicon sequencing, and shotgun metagenomic sequencing was performed on 94 samples from the 4M time point. The microbiome of babies whose families lived in lower socioeconomic status (SES) areas exhibited a significantly higher microbial alpha diversity at D10 (Wilcoxon test, p = 0.021), greater abundance of Bifidobacterium (linear model, q = 0.020) at D10 and Megasphaera (q = 0.031) at 4M. Hospital of birth explained 5.2% of the observed variance in 4M samples (PERMANOVA, p = 0.038), with Staphylococcus aureus more abundant in fecal samples from babies born in Middlemore hospital (linear model, q = 0.016). Maternal antibiotic (Wilcoxon test, p = 0.013) and probiotic (p = 0.04) usage within the four-week period before sample collection was associated with a reduction in the alpha diversity of D10 samples.

The Lactobacillus species constitutes an important part of kefir grains. In a previous animal study, kefir effectively improved exercise performance and had anti-fatigue effects. The purpose of this research was to explore the benefits of applying kefir to improve exercise performance, reduce fatigue, and improve physiological adaptability in humans. The test used a double-blind crossover design and supplementation for 28 days. Sixteen 20–30 year-old subjects were divided into two groups in a balanced order according to each individual’s initial maximal oxygen uptake and were assigned to receive a placebo (equal flavor, equal calories, 20 g/day) or SYNKEFIR™ (20 g/day) every morning. After the intervention, there were 28 days of wash-out, during which time the subjects did not receive further interventions. After supplementation with SYNKEFIR™, the exercise time to exhaustion was significantly greater than that before ingestion (p = 0.0001) and higher than that in the Placebo group by 1.29-fold (p = 0.0004). In addition, compared with the Placebo group, the SYNKEFIR™ administration group had significantly lower lactate levels in the exercise and recovery (p < 0.05). However, no significant difference was observed in the changes in the gut microbiota. Although no significant changes in body composition were found, SYNKEFIR™ did not cause adverse reactions or harm to the participants’ bodies. In summary, 28 days of supple-mentation with SYNKEFIR™ significantly improved exercise performance, reduced the production of lactic acid after exercise, and accelerated recovery while also not causing any adverse reactions. © 2021 by the authors.

The above-mentioned changes of the caecum microbiota led to significantly higher villus height (p = 0.003) of the OAs broiler group and significantly lower crypt depth (p = 0.037). Notwithstanding the significant increase of acetic, propionic, isobutyric, butyric, isovaleric, and valeric acids that were established in caecum samples from the MCFAs group, better parameters of broiler production performance (higher body weight and lower mortality) and carcass traits (higher both thigh and shin muscles with skin and bone weight; both shin muscles without skin and bone weight; abdominal fat yield) were found in the OAs-treated group. For chemical, physical and technological characteristics of breast meat samples, increased yellowness and water holding capacity by 14.7% and 2.3%, respectively, were found in MCFAs group samples. A more appropriate environment in the caecum for beneficial microorganisms could be obtained when BCs were fed with OAs supplement, comparing to MCFAs, and these positive changes were associated with higher efficiency of poultry production. © 2021 by the author.

A total of 60 Yorkshire × Landrace sows (3–6 of parity) were arranged from day 85 of gestation to the end of lactation in a completely randomized design with three treatments (control diet, control diet + lysozyme 150 mg/kg, control diet + lysozyme 300 mg/kg). The results showed that sows fed with lysozyme increased serum interleukin‐10 (IL‐10, p < 0.05) on day 7 of lactation. The vaginal microbiota varied at different taxonomic levels with LZM supplementation by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The most representative changes included a decrease in Tenericutes, Streptococcus, Bacillus and increase in Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Enterococcus, and Lactobacillus (p < 0.05). There were 777 OTUs exist-ing in both, vaginal and fecal microbiota. The addition of LZM also decreased the abundance of Tenericutes (p < 0.05) in the vagina and feces. The changes in the microbiota were correlated in some cases positively with the performance of the sow, for example, Bacillus in feces was positively correlated with the neonatal weight (p < 0.05). These results indicate that the addition of lysozyme to the diet of sow during perinatal period promote the change of vaginal bacterial community after farrowing. The variations in vaginal microbiota are also associated with the changes in the fecal microbiology of the rectum and the reproductive performance of the sow. Therefore, it is concluded that dietary supplementation with lysozyme in sows in late gestation stage until early lactation, is beneficial to establish vaginal microbiota that seems to promote maternal health and reproductive performance. © 2021 by the authors.

However, new alternatives are being sought due to an expected ban on zinc oxide in feed supplementation from 2022 in the EU. One possible alternative is to use novel types of probiotics consisting of microbiota characteristic for healthy weaned piglets. In this study, we therefore collected rectal swabs of piglets 3 days before weaning and 4 days after weaning in a commercial farm considering all risks of field trial like the use of antibiotics, classified the piglets as predisposed, healthy or sick and using 16S rRNA sequencing, we determined and compared the microbiota composition. Increased Actinobacteria before weaning was a marker of piglets predisposed for diarrhea. Increased Chlamydia or Helicobacter before weaning was surprisingly a marker of healthy and resistant piglets after weaning. After weaning, unclassified Clostridiales, Deltaproteobacteria, Selenomonadales, Fusobacterium, Akkermansia or Anaerovibrio increased in microbiota of piglets with postweaning diarrhea while an increase in Prevotella and Faecalibacterium was characteristic for healthy, weaned piglets. Both changes in individual microbiota members and also correct timing of microbiota reshaping around weaning and the increase of mainly Prevotella species just after weaning are equally important for resistance to postweaning diarrhea in piglets under field conditions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",8.0

MR-7 on the growth performance, immunity, and intestinal microbiota of Pacific white shrimp",2021,Aquaculture Reports,10.1016/j.aqrep.2021.100595,"The practice of adding probiotics in shrimp diet has increased significantly because of its beneficial effects on growth performance and disease resistance. However, little attention has been paid to marine-derived probiotics, which might be more suitable for aquatic animals. In the present study, an 8-week feeding trial was carried out to explore the effects of Shewanella sp. MR-7 in shrimp diet. Three concentrations of Shewanella sp. MR-7 (SS-MR-7, 106 colony forming units (CFU)/g diet, F1; 107 CFU/g diet, F2; 108 CFU/g diet, F3) were added to the basal diet (F0) of Pacific white shrimp. At the end of the trial, an acute ammonia stress test was performed. The results showed that supplementation with 107 CFU SS-MR-7 per g diet significantly improved shrimp weight gained and specific growth rate. A significantly higher shrimp survival rate was also observed in the F2 group after acute ammonia stress. Meanwhile, dietary SS-MR-7 induced the hepatopancreatic mRNA expression of antioxidation-related genes encoding heat shock protein 70, thioredoxin 1, and glutathione peroxidase, as well as immunity-related genes, such as those encoding lipopolysaccharide and beta-1,3-glucan-binding protein, prophenoloxidase activating factor, and prophenoloxidase. Furthermore, the intestinal microbiota was responsive to the diets. The abundance of the beneficial bacteria Pseudomonas was enriched, while the contents of potential pathogens (such as Bacteroides and Escherichia-shigella) decreased. Overall, our results indicate that SS-MR-7 could be an effective probiotic in shrimp culture as it increase growth performance, immunity and the abundance of intestinal beneficial bacterial. © 2021",3.0

Emerging evidence has suggested that the gut microbiome is a pivotal player in maintaining animal health and can potentially altered by xenobiotic. However, few studies explored whether PFOA-induced liver injury is associated with gut microbiota dysbiosis. In the present study, the effects of subacute and subchronic PFOA exposure on liver and gut microbiota in C57BL/6J mice were investigated. Our findings showed that both subacute and subchronic exposure to PFOA induced the liver inflammation, disrupted antioxidative homeostasis and caused liver histological abnormalities with detectable hepatomegaly, ultimately triggering liver injury. Besides, 16S rRNA sequencing analysis revealed that subacute PFOA exposure caused significant changes in the abundances of intestinal flora known to contribute to liver inflammation and oxidative stress, such as the Dehalobacterium and Bacteroides genera. Exposure to subchronic toxicity mainly induced the decrease in commensal probiotics including Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium genera, which are potentially beneficial to liver damage, compared with that in the untreated group. They also resulted in disturbed functional capabilities of the microbial communities by a Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt) analysis. Additionally, the levels of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), especially butyric acid, were significantly reduced by PFOA administration. Collectively, our observations suggested that liver damage induced by both subacute and subchronic PFOA exposures probably partly related to the gut microbiota dysbiosis and provided a new insight into the role of PFOA in liver injury. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",13.0

We aim to investigate the impact of probiotics on eradication rate and gut microbiota during eradication therapy. Methods: A total of 162 patients receiving bismuth quadruple therapy were enrolled and randomly assigned to groups given probiotics (n = 83) or placebo (n = 79) for 4 weeks. Fecal samples were collected before treatment and 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks after eradication therapy. Gut microbiota was analyzed by 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing. Results: The eradication rates in the placebo and probiotics group were 82.43% and 87.01%, respectively (P > 0.05). Compared with baseline, alpha and beta diversity was significantly altered 2 weeks after eradication in both groups, which was restored at week 8. There were no significant differences in diversity between the two groups. H. pylori eradication therapy resulted in enrichment of some detrimental bacteria taxa such as Shigella, Klebsiella, and Streptococcus, while probiotics supplementation could rapidly restore these taxa levels after eradication and increase the taxa of Bacillus and Lactobacillales. Functional analysis revealed that lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis and polymyxin resistance pathways were significantly enriched after eradication, while probiotics supplementation mainly enriched the cofactors and vitamins metabolism pathways. Increased relative abundances of Roseburia and Dialister were associated with the positive eradication outcome. Conclusions: Probiotics supplementation might help to construct a beneficial profile of gut microbiota after eradication therapy. Specific bacteria taxa are associated with H. pylori eradication outcome. These findings may be of value in rational use of probiotics during H. pylori eradication.

More than 1 million people die each year due to these diseases, but why most H. pylori-infected individuals remain asymptomatic while a certain proportion develops such severe gastric diseases remained an enigma. Several studies indicated that gastric and intestinal microbiota may play a critical role in the development of the H. pylori-associated diseases. However, no specific microbe in the gastric or intestinal microbiota has been clearly linked to H. pylori infection and related gastric diseases. Here, we studied H. pylori infection, its virulence genes, the intestinal microbiota, and the clinical status of Trivandrum residents (N = 375) in southwestern India by standard H. pylori culture, PCR genotype, Sanger sequencing, and microbiome analyses using Illumina Miseq and Nanopore GridION. Our analyses revealed that gastric colonization by virulent H. pylori strains (vacAs1i1m1cagA+) is necessary but not sufficient for developing these diseases. Conversely, distinct microbial pools exist in the lower gut of the H. pylori-infected vs. H. pylori-non-infected individuals. Bifidobacterium (belonging to the phylum Actinobacteria) and Bacteroides (belonging to the phylum Bacteroidetes) were present in lower relative abundance for the H. pylori+ group than the H. pylori- group (p < 0.05). On the contrary, for the H. pylori+ group, genus Dialister (bacteria belonging to the phylum Firmicutes) and genus Prevotella (bacteria belonging to the phylum Bacteroidetes) were present in higher abundance compared to the H. pylori- group (p < 0.05). Notably, those who carried H. pylori in the stomach and had developed aggressive gastric diseases also had extremely low relative abundance (p < 0.05) of several Bifidobacterium species (e.g., B. adolescentis, B. longum) in the lower gut suggesting a protective role of Bifidobacterium. Our results show the link between lower gastrointestinal microbes and upper gastrointestinal diseases. Moreover, the results are important for developing effective probiotic and early prognosis of severe gastric diseases. © Copyright © 2021 Devi, Devadas, George, Gandhimathi, Chouhan, Retnakumar, Alexander, Varghese, Dharmaseelan, Chandrika, Jissa, Das, Nair and Chattopadhyay.",5.0

A total of 720 one-day-old chicks were randomly divided into four groups. The control and Cp group were only fed a basal diet, while the two treatment groups received basal diets supplemented with Lac16 (1 × 108 cfu·kg−1) and BSC10 (1 × 108 cfu·kg−1) for 21 days, respectively. On day 1 and days 14 to 20, birds except those in the control group were challenged with 1 × 108 cfu C. perfringens type A strain once a day. The results showed that both Lac16 and BSC10 could ameliorate intestinal structure damage caused by C. perfringens infection. C. perfringens infection induced apoptosis by increasing the expression of Bax and p53 and decreasing Bcl-2 expression and inflammation evidence by higher levels of IFN-γ, IL-6, IL-1β, iNOS, and IL-10 in the ileum mucosa, and NO production in jejunal mucosa, which was reversed by Lac16 and BSC10 treatment except for IL-1β (P &lt; 0.05). Besides, the two probiotics restored the intestinal microbiota imbalance induced by C. perfringens infection, characterized by the reduced Firmicutes and Proteobacteria and the increased Bacteroidetes at the phyla level and decreased Bacteroides fragilis and Gallibacterium anatis at the genus level. The two probiotics also reversed metabolic pathways of the microbiota in C. perfringens-infected broilers, including B-vitamin biosynthesis, peptidoglycan biosynthesis, and pyruvate fermentation to acetate and lactate II pathway. In conclusion, Lac16 and BSC10 can effectively protect broilers against C. perfringens infection through improved composition and metabolic pathways of the intestinal microbiota, intestinal structure, inflammation, and anti-apoptosis. © Copyright © 2021 Gong, Wang, Zhou, Tang, Zeng, Zhang and Li.",4.0

B. pseudocatenulatum MY40C and CCFM680 were administered to mice with DSS-induced colitis. The content of tight junction proteins and mucin2 was significantly upregulated. TNF-α and IL-6 were downregulated, while IL-10 and PPAR-γwere upregulated. TLR4/NF-κB pathway activation was significantly inhibited. Moreover, each treated strain increased Allobaculum and decreased Sutterella, Bacteroides, and Oscillospira. The colonic conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) concentrations were significantly and positively correlated with the effectiveness of strain in relieving colitis.

However, such studies have not been conducted in the Chinese population. Stool sample sequencing of the gene encoding the 16S rRNA of 82 prospectively enrolled 3- and 30-42-day-old vaginal and cesarean section delivered newborns was performed to study the composition and predicted function of the intestinal microbiota. In the samples from the 3-day-old neonates, the levels of Escherichia-Shigella in the two groups were similar. The genera Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Bacteroides were more prominent in the vaginal delivery than in the cesarean section group, which showed a predominance of Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Corynebacterium. The differences between the two groups were statistically significant (p< 0.05). In the samples from 30- to 42-day-old infants, Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Escherichia-Shigella, and Bacteroides were the main genera present in the vaginal delivery group, while in the cesarean section delivery group; the predominant genera were Escherichia-Shigella, Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, and Staphylococcus. Predicted functions of the vaginal delivery group revealed higher metabolic and biodegradation rates of carbohydrates, vitamins, and xenobiotics than those in the cesarean section group, which contributed to the stability of the microbiota in the former. The abundance of probiotic bacteria such as Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus, and the negative correlation between obesity and Bacteroides presence were higher in vaginally delivered infants than in cesarean-delivered infants at both studied time points. © 2021 Kaiyu Pan et al.",2.0

Previous studies have shown that weight loss interventions have an impact on gut microbiota. However, a pattern of gut microbiota changes associated with weight loss independently of the type of intervention has not been described yet. This study includes 61 individuals who followed different weight loss strategies in three different trials: 21 followed a hypocaloric Mediterranean diet (MedDiet), 18 followed a very-low-calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD) and 22 patients underwent sleeve gastrectomy bariatric surgery (BS). Gut microbiota profile was assessed by next-generation sequencing. A common taxon that had significantly changed within the three weight loss interventions could not be find. At the family level, Clostiridiaceae significantly increased its abundance with MedDiet and VLCKD, whilst Porphyromonadacean and Rikenellaceae significantly increased with VLCKD and BS. At genus level, in VLCKD and BS, Parabacteroides and Alistipes significantly increased their abundance whilst Lactobacillus decreased. At the species level, BS and VLCKD produced an increase in Parabacteroides distasonis and a decrease in Eubactierium ventriosum and Lactobacillus rogosae, whilst Orodibacter splanchnicus increased its abundance after the BS and MedDiet. Predicted metagenome analysis suggested that most of the changes after VLCKD were focused on pathways related to biosynthesis and degradation/utilization/assimilation, while BS seems to decrease most of the biosynthesis pathways. MedDiet was enriched in several pathways related to fermentation to short-chain fatty acids. Our results show that weight loss is not associated with a specific pattern of gut microbiota changes independently of the strategy used.

Faecal microbiota transplant (FMT) can act as a promising approach to treat IBD by which changes in microbiome can be reversed and homeostasis restored. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of FMT on the remission of acute inflammatory response using dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced rat colitis model. Faecal microbial communities were analysed using the 16S rRNA approach, and clinical manifestations together with histological/haematological/biochemical/immunological analyses were assessed. Our study demonstrated significant shifts in the dominant species of microbiota under inflammatory conditions induced by DSS and evident restoration effect of FMT treatment on microbial composition. These faecal microbial alterations in FMT-treated rats led to a relative restoration of colon length, and a significant decrease in both epithelium damage and disease severity, which was reflected in lower serum pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. Haematological/biochemical parameters in DSS-treated animals showed signs of anaemia with a significant reduction in red blood cell count together with increasing levels of total bilirubin, creatinine and phosphorus suggesting potential protective effect of FMT.

The oropharynx is a key target for colonization by several important human pathogens. To understand how the oropharyngeal microbiome might limit infections, and how intercurrent infections might be associated with its composition, we characterized the oropharyngeal microbiome of 18 healthy adults, sampled weekly over a 40-weeks using culture-independent molecular techniques. We detected nine phyla, 202 genera and 1438 assignments on OTU level, dominated by Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria on phylum level. Individual microbiomes of participants were characterized by levels of high alpha diversity (mean = 204.55 OTUs, sd = 35.64), evenness (19.83, sd = 9.74) and high temporal stability (mean Pearson’s correlation between samples of 0.52, sd = 0.060), with greater differences in microbiome community composition between than within individuals. Significant changes in community composition were associated with disease states, suggesting that it is possible to detect specific changes in OTU abundance and community composition during illness. We defined the common core microbiota by varying occurrence and abundance thresholds showing that individual core microbiomes share a substantial number of OTUs across participants, chiefly Streptococci and Veillonella. Our results provide insights into the microbial communities that characterize the healthy human oropharynx, community structure and variability, and provide new approaches to define individual and shared cores. The wider implications of this result include the potential for modeling the general dynamics of oropharynx microbiota both in health and in response to antimicrobial treatments or probiotics. © Copyright © 2021 Bach, Ram, Ijaz, Evans and Lindström.",1.0

METHODS: Subjects who were 16-18 years with Crohn's in remission (weighted pediatric Crohn's disease activity index <12.5) were recruited. Each active dose comprised ;108.261.4 colony forming units of B. thetaiotaomicron (randomized 4:1 active:placebo). Part A was single dose. Part B involved 7.5 days twice daily dosing. Serial stools were analyzed for calprotectin, 16S rRNA sequencing, and B. thetaiotaomicron real-time polymerase chain reaction. Bloods were taken serially. Subjects reported adverse events and recorded temperature twice daily. RESULTS: Fifteen subjects were treated-8 in part A (75%men, median 17.1 years) and 10 in part B, including 3 from part A (80% men, median 17.1 years); all 18 completed. Seventy percent took concurrent immunosuppression. Reported compliance was >99% in part B. Two subjects reported adverse events deemed related-one in part A with eructation, flatulence, and reflux; one in part B with dizziness, abdominal pain, and headache. No serious adverse events were reported. There was no significant change in median calprotectin across part B (87.8 [4.4-447] to 50.5 [5.3-572], P 5 0.44 by the Fisher exact test in the active group). No significant differences were found in microbiota profiles, but diversity seemed to increase in treated subjects. DISCUSSION: Thetanix, after single and multiple doses, was well tolerated. Although the numbers in this study were small, the safety profile seems good. Future studies should explore efficacy. © 2021 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins. All rights reserved.",3.0

We determined the ability of 57 bacterial strains within the Family Lactobacillaceae and genera Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides and potentially pathogenic bacteria to ferment the HMOs 2′-fucosyllactose, 3-fucosyllactose, and difucosyllactose. In addition, prebiotic galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS), lactose, fucose, and glucose were evaluated as carbon sources for these bacterial strains. Bacterial growth was monitored using the automatic Bioscreen C system. Only certain bifidobacteria, such as Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis and Bifidobacterium bifidum, as well as Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides vulgatus, and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron utilized the studied HMOs as their sole carbon source, whereas almost all studied bacterial strains were able to utilize GOS, lactose, and glucose. The selectivity in utilization of HMOs by only certain bacteria can be advantageous by promoting beneficial microbes but not supporting the harmful pathogens in contrast to other less selective prebiotics. © 2020 The Authors.

As such, BiNx with Candida administration (BiNx- Candida) enhanced intestinal injury (colon cytokines and apoptosis), gut leakage (fluorescein isothiocyanate [FITC]-dextran assay, endotoxemia, serum BG, and bacteremia) systemic inflammation, and liver injury at 48 h postsurgery compared with non-Candida BiNx mice. Interestingly, uremia-induced enterocyte apoptosis was severe enough for gut translocation of viable bacteria, as indicated by culture positivity for bacteria in blood, mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs), and other organs, which was more severe in BiNx-Candida than in non-Candida BiNx mice. Candida induced alterations in the gut microbiota of BiNx mice as indicated by (i) the higher fungal burdens in the feces of BiNx-Candida mice than in sham-Candida mice by culture methods and (ii) increased Bacteroides with decreased Firmicutes and reduced bacterial diversity in the feces of BiNx-Candida mice compared with non-Candida BiNx mice by fecal microbiome analysis. In addition, lipopolysaccharide plus BG (LPS1BG), compared with each molecule alone induced high supernatant cytokine levels, which were enhanced by uremic mouse serum in both hepatocytes (HepG2 cells) and macrophages (RAW264.7 cells). Moreover LPS1BG, but not each molecule alone, reduced the glycolysis capacity and mitochondrial function in HepG2 cells as determined by extracellular flux analysis. Additionally, a probiotic, Lactobacillus rhamnosus L34 (L34), attenuated disease severity only in BiNx- Candida mice but not in non-Candida BiNx mice, as indicated by liver injury and serum cytokines through the attenuation of gut leakage, the fecal abundance of fungi, and fecal bacterial diversity but not fecal Gram-negative bacteria. In conclusion, Candida enhanced BiNx severity through the worsening of gut leakage and microbiota alterations that resulted in bacteremia, endotoxemia, and glucanemia.

The role of IL-9 is paradigmatic because it can either promote tumor progression in hematological malignancies or inhibit tumorigenesis in solid cancers. Therefore, we investigate the microbiota–immunity axis in healthy and tumor mucosa, focusing on the correlation between cytokine profile and GM signature. Methods: In this observational study, we collected tumor (CRC) and healthy (CRC-S) mucosa samples from 45 CRC patients, who were undergoing surgery in 2018 at the Careggi University Hospital (Florence, Italy). First, we characterized the tissue infiltrating lymphocyte subset profile and the GM composition. Subsequently, we evaluated the CRC and CRC-S molecular inflammatory response and correlated this profile with GM composition, using Dirichlet multinomial regression. Results: CRC samples displayed higher percentages of Th17, Th2, and Tregs. Moreover, CRC tissues showed significantly higher levels of MIP-1α, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-2, IP-10, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17A, IFN-γ, TNF-α, MCP-1, P-selectin, and IL-9. Compared to CRC-S, CRC samples also showed significantly higher levels of the following genera: Fusobacteria, Proteobacteria, Fusobacterium, Ruminococcus2, and Ruminococcus. Finally, the abundance of Prevotella spp. in CRC samples negatively correlated with IL-17A and positively with IL-9. On the contrary, Bacteroides spp. presence negatively correlated with IL-9. Conclusions: Our data consolidate antitumor immunity impairment and the presence of a distinct microbiota profile in the tumor microenvironment compared with the healthy mucosa counterpart. Relating the CRC cytokine profile with GM composition, we confirm the presence of bidirectional crosstalk between the immune response and the host’s commensal microorganisms. Indeed, we document, for the first time, that Prevotella spp. and Bacteroides spp. are, respectively, positively and negatively correlated with IL-9, whose role in CRC development is still under debate. © Copyright © 2021 Niccolai, Russo, Baldi, Ricci, Nannini, Pedone, Stingo, Taddei, Ringressi, Bechi, Mengoni, Fani, Bacci, Fagorzi, Chiellini, Prisco, Ramazzotti and Amedei.",5.0

Probiotics can regulate the intestinal flora and ameliorate IBD. The probiotic Bacillus subtilis strain B. subtilis JNFE0126 was used as the starter of fermented milk. However, the therapeutic effects of B. subtilis-fermented milk on IBD remain to be explored. In this research, the therapeutic effect of B. subtilis-fermented milk on dextran sulfate sodium salt (DSS)-induced IBD mouse model was evaluated. Besides, the expression of pro-inflammatory/anti-inflammatory cytokines, the proliferation of the intestinal stem cells, and the reconstruction of the mucosa barrier were investigated. Finally, alteration of the gut microbiota was investigated by taxonomic analysis. As shown by the results, the disease activity index (DAI) of IBD was significantly decreased through oral administration of B. subtilis (JNFE0126)-fermented milk, and intestinal mucosa injury was attenuated. Moreover, B. subtilis could reduce the inflammatory response of the intestinal mucosa, induce proliferation of the intestinal stem cell, and promote reconstruction of the mucosal barrier. Furthermore, B. subtilis could rebalance the intestinal flora, increasing the abundance of Bacillus, Alistipes, and Lactobacillus while decreasing the abundance of Escherichia and Bacteroides. In conclusion, oral administration of the B. subtilis-fermented milk could alleviate DSS-induced IBD via inhibition of inflammatory response, promotion of the mucosal barrier reconstruction, and regulation of the intestinal flora. © Copyright © 2021 Zhang, Tong, Lyu, Wang, Wang and Yang.",6.0

Association of probiotics with human beings has a lot of history. Well known as 'health-friendly bacteria', they are widely used commercially as a functional food. The popularity of probiotics has gone exponentially high due to an increasing number of clinical trials, supporting their beneficial effects. Several in vivo and in-vitro experimental evidence supports strain-specific and disease-specific probiotic efficacy to prevent and ameliorate antibiotic-associated diarrhoea, traveller's diarrhoea, ulcerative colitis, and many more. Besides, numerous recent studies have reported that probiotics could have a significant effect in alleviating various metabolic, lifestyle and diet-related disorders like obesity, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome Strains of Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus and Saccharomyces boulardii are the most commonly used as probiotics. Safety, efficacy, pathogenicity, infectivity, intrinsic property, virulence factors are to be addressed during probiotic selection. The underlying mechanisms of probiotics effects are still not fully elucidated and have been under intensive research. Numerous diverse, strain-specific probiotic mechanisms have been proposed, which include early colonization of perturbed microbes, competitive exclusion of pathogens, short-chain volatile fatty acid production, alteration of gut pH, immunomodulation and many more. Considering the remarkable influence on human health, probiotics seem to be alluring attractive agents to promote human health conditions and to improve the quality of life against several diseases. This review discusses the current documentation and recent advances on probiotics and their possible health attributes, in scientific literature, focusing on diverse, heterogeneous, and strain-specific mechanisms of action. Randomised human controlled clinical trials are needed to reconfirm its safety and beneficial effects. © 2021 Oriental Scientific Publishing Company.",
"Ceballos D., Hernández-Camba A., Ramos L.",Diet and microbiome in the beginning of the sequence of gut inflammation,2021,World Journal of Clinical Cases,10.12998/wjcc.v9.i36.11122,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal tract due, at least partially, to an aberrant and excessive mucosalimmune response to gut bacteria in genetically-predisposed individuals undercertain environmental factors. The incidence of IBD is rising in western and newlyindustrialized countries, paralleling the increase of westernized dietary patterns,through new antigens, epithelial function and permeability, epigenetic mechanisms(e.g., DNA methylation), and alteration of the gut microbiome.Alteration in the composition and functionality of the gut microbiome (includingbacteria, viruses and fungi) seems to be a nuclear pathogenic factor. Themicrobiome itself is dynamic, and the changes in food quality, dietary habits,living conditions and hygiene of these western societies, could interact in acomplex manner as modulators of dysbiosis, thereby influencing the activation ofimmune cells’ promoting inflammation. The microbiome produces diverse smallmolecules via several metabolic ways, with the fiber-derived short-chain fattyacids (i.e., butyrate) as main elements and having anti-inflammatory effects. Thesemetabolites and some micronutrients of the diet (i.e., vitamins, folic acid, betacarotene and trace elements) are regulators of innate and adaptive intestinalimmune homeostasis. An excessive and unhealthy consumption of sugar, animalfat and a low-vegetable and -fiber diet are risk factors for IBD appearance. Furthermore,metabolism of nutrients in intestinal epithelium and in gut microbiotais altered by inflammation, changing the demand for nutrients needed forhomeostasis. This role of food and a reduced gut microbial diversity in causingIBD might also have a prophylactic or therapeutic role for IBD. The relationship between dietary intake, symptoms, and bowel inflammation could lead to dietaryand lifestyle recommendations, including diets with abundant fruits, vegetables,olive oil and oily fish, which have anti-inflammatory effects and could preventdysbiosis and IBD.

Forty-four patients with diabetes were included. The control group included 47 healthy people. Their data, biochemical indicators and results from 16S rRNA sequencing of their fecal samples were collected. Compared with the healthy population, the intestinal flora of the diabetic patients was obviously abnormal. Within the diabetes group, the abundances of the genera Faecalibacterium, Prevotella, and Roseburia were higher, and the abundances of the genera Shigella and Bifidobacterium were lower. In the correlation analysis between bacteria and clinical indicators, it was found that the genera Veillonella and unclassified_Enterobacteriaceae were negatively related to blood glucose, while the genera Phascolarctobacterium, unidentified_Bacteroidales and Prevotella were significantly positively correlated with fasting blood glucose. Twelve microbial markers were detected in the random forest model, and the area under the curve (AUC) was 84.1%. This index was greater than the diagnostic effect of fasting blood glucose. This was also supported by the joint diagnostic model of microorganisms and clinical indicators. In addition, the intestinal flora significantly improved the diagnosis of diabetes. In conclusion, it can be concluded from these results that intestinal flora is essential for the occurrence and development of diabetes, which seems to be as important as blood glucose itself.

As a transitional state between normal aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is characterized by a worse cognitive decline than that of natural aging. The association between AD and gut microbiota has been reported in a number of studies; however, microbial research regarding MCI remains limited. Methods. This study examined 48 participants, of whom 22 were MCI cases and 26 were normal control cases. Fecal samples were collected for 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) quantitative arrays and bioinformatics analysis. Results. A principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) and nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) both demonstrated that the microbial composition of participants with MCI deviated from that of healthy control participants. Multiple bacterial species were significantly increased (e.g., Staphylococcus intermedius) or decreased (e.g., Bacteroides salyersiae) in samples from the MCI group. Conclusion. The composition of gut microbiota differed between normal control and MCI cases. This is the first study to identify a signature series of species in the gut microbiota of individuals with MCI.

Gastrodin has been reported to have hepatoprotective effect. However, whether gastrodin can alleviate PFOA-induced liver injury via modulating gut microbiota remains unclear. Herein, a PFOA-induced liver injury model was established by gavage of PFOA (5 mg/kg body weight) in 2% Tween 80 solution once daily for 6 weeks in mice, and then gastrodin in saline (20 mg/kg body weight) was used once daily for 8 weeks to treat liver damage. The biochemical indexes associated with liver function, oxidative stress, and inflammatory factors were examined. Hematoxylin-eosin staining was used to determine the liver histopathological changes. Besides, 16S rRNA sequencing was used to analyze the difference of gut microbiota between the model and treatment groups. The results showed that gastrodin significantly improved the oxidative stress caused by PFOA. Intestinal flora analysis showed that gastrodin treatment significantly increased the relative abundance of probiotics, such as Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Bacteroides, while the harmful bacteria, including Desulfovibrio were decreased. Gastrodin treatment also significantly increased the level of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as butyric acid and isobutyric acid. Spearman correlation analysis showed that the composition changes of gut microbiota and SCFAs increase were both beneficial to alleviate the liver injury caused by PFOA. To sum up, gastrodin can effectively alleviate PFOA-induced liver injury through regulating gut microbiota composition. © 2021 The Author(s).

The extent to which the impact of different changes in intestinal flora would have on the metabolism of an individual has not been reported. This study aims to investigate the effect of different changes in intestinal flora on the metabolism of Sprague–Dawley (SD) normal rats’ individuals. Forty-eight SD rats were randomly divided into 6 groups (8 rats per group), which were treated with normal saline, probiotics, nonpathogenic Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, gentamicin, and magnesium sulfate, respectively. After 7 days, the ileum of each group of rats was collected and real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to analyze the composition of intestinal flora. And gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) was used to analyze plasma metabolic profile. The results revealed that the decrease in alanine content in the probiotics group was statistically significant, while the alanine content in the nonpathogenic Escherichia group increased significantly. Alanine, leucine, isoleucine, and serine decreased significantly in the Salmonella group. Proline and butyric acid decreased significantly in the gentamicin group. The principal component analysis showed significant differences in the Salmonella group compared with other test groups. Overall, the most significant metabolic changes were observed in SD rats in the Salmonella group, while a great similarity was observed in the probiotics, Escherichia group, and gentamicin groups compared with the normal group. Changes in intestinal flora had a certain impact on the metabolism in SD rats, especially on amino acid levels. © 2021 The Author(s).

Methods: 85 patients with colorectal cancer who presented in our cancer center between 2018 and September 2019 were selected to form the colorectal cancer study group, and 60 healthy individuals who visited the hospital for physical examination were selected to form the normal control group Logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the risk factors of intestinal flora abnormalities in patients with colorectal cancer. Results: The number of fecal Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium, and yeast in the colorectal cancer group was significantly higher than in the control group, while the number of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus in the colorectal cancer group was significantly lower than in the control group (P<.05). The relative content of Bacteroides and the number of butyrate-producing bacteria in the colorectal cancer group were significantly lower than in the control group (P<.05). There was no significant difference in total bacterial gene copy number, Bacteroides gene copy number, and coenzyme A (CoA) gene copy number between the two groups (P>.05). Binary logistic regression analysis showed that abnormal body mass index and medication history were risk factors for intestinal flora abnormalities in colorectal cancer patients (OR = 1.609 and 6.059, respectively; P = .003 and .036, respectively). Conclusion: The number of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium and yeast in the intestinal flora of patients with colorectal cancer is significantly higher, indicating that abnormal changes in flora may be an important factor in the occurrence and development of colorectal cancer.

Interventions to restore a healthy GM composition may have the potential to improve health and disease outcomes in the elderly. We performed a comprehensive characterization of changes in the luminal and mucosa-associated microbiota composition in elderly compared with younger healthy individuals. Samples from saliva and feces, and biopsies from the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract (UGIT, LGIT), were collected from 59 asymptomatic individuals grouped by age: 40–55, 56–70, and 71–85 years). All underwent anthropometric, geriatric, and nutritional assessment. RNA was extracted and reverse-transcribed into complementary DNA; the V1–V2 regions of 16S ribosomal RNA genes were amplified and sequenced. Abundances of the taxa in all taxonomic ranks in each sample type were used to construct sample-similarity matrices by the Bray–Curtis algorithm. Significant differences between defined groups were assessed by analysis of similarity. The bacterial community showed strong interindividual variations and a clear distinction between samples from UGIT, LGIT, and feces. While in saliva some taxa were affected by aging, this number was considerably greater in UGIT and was subsequently higher in LGIT. Unexpectedly, aging scarcely influenced the bacterial community of feces over the age range of 40–85 years. The development of interventions to preserve and restore human health with increased age by establishing a healthy gut microbiome should not rely solely on data from fecal analysis, as the intestinal mucosa is affected by more significant changes, which differ from those observed in fecal analyses. © 2021 The Author(s).

The purpose of this study was to begin translation of these preclinical data by examining whether vascular phenotypes in humans are transmissible through the gut microbiota. We hypothesized that germ-free mice colonized with gut microbiota from obese individuals would display diminished vascular function compared to germ-free mice receiving microbiota from lean individuals. We transplanted fecal material from obese and lean age-and sex-matched participants with disparate vascular function to germ-free mice. Using Principle Component Analysis, the microbiota of colonized mice separated by donor group along the first principle component, accounting for between 70–93% of the total variability in the dataset. The microbiota of mice receiving transplants from lean individuals was also characterized by increased alpha diversity, as well as increased relative abundance of potentially beneficial bacteria, including Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Bacteroides ovatis. Endothelium-dependent dilation, aortic pulse wave velocity and glucose tolerance were significantly altered in mice receiving microbiota from the obese donor relative to those receiving microbiota from the lean donor or those remaining germ-free. These data indicate that the obesity-associated human gut microbiota is sufficient to alter the vascular phenotype in germ-free mice in the absence of differences in body weight or dietary manipulation, and provide justification for future clinical trials to test the efficacy of microbiota-targeted therapies in the prevention or treatment of cardiovascular disease. © 2021 The Author(s).

Prophylactic use of probiotics has been suggested to protect preterm infants via supporting a healthy gut microbiota (GM) development, but the suggested strains and doses vary between studies. In this study, we profiled the GM of 5, 10 and 30-day fecal samples from two cohorts of preterm neonates (born <30 weeks of gestation) recruited in the same neonatal intensive care unit. One cohort (n = 165) was recruited from September 2006 to January 2009 before probiotics were introduced in the clinic. The second cohort (n = 87) was recruited from May 2010 to October 2011 after introducing Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG and Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis BB-12 supplementation policy. Through V3-V4 region 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, a distinct increase of L. rhamnosus and B. animalis was found in the fecal samples of neonates supplemented with probiotics. During the first 30 days of life, the preterm GM went through similarly patterned progression of bacterial populations. Staphylococcus and Weissella dominated in early samples, but was gradually overtaken by Veillonella, Enterococcus and Enterobacteriaceae. Probiotic supplementation was associated with pronounced reduction of Weissella, Veillonella spp. and the opportunistic pathogen Klebsiella. Potential nosocomial pathogens Citrobacter and Chryseobacterium species also gradually phased out. In conclusion, probiotic supplementation to preterm neonates affected gut colonization by certain bacteria, but did not change the overall longitudinal bacterial progression in the neonatal period.

Recent studies have pointed out that the gut microbiota could play a crucial role in the development of colorectal adenomas and the consequent progression to colorectal cancer. Some gut bacteria, such as Fusobacterium nucleatum, Escherichia coli, Clostridium difficile, Peptostreptococcus, and enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis, could be implicated in colorectal carcinogenesis through different mechanisms, including the maintenance of a chronic inflammatory state, production of bioactive tumorigenic metabolites, and DNA damage. Studies using the adenomatous polyposis coliMin/+ mouse model, which resembles FAP in most respects, have shown that specific changes in the intestinal microbial community could influence a multistep progression, the intestinal “adenoma-carcinoma sequence”, which involves mucosal barrier injury, low-grade inflammation, activation of the Wnt pathway. Therefore, modulation of gut microbiota might represent a novel therapeutic target for patients with FAP. Administration of probiotics, prebiotics, antibiotics, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs could potentially prevent the progression of the adenoma-carcinoma sequence in FAP. The aim of this review was to summarize the best available knowledge on the role of gut microbiota in colorectal carcinogenesis in patients with FAP. © The Author(s) 2021.

The etiopathogenesis of the disease remains unclear. Areas covered: The human body hosts a remarkably abundant and diverse community of microbial species called microbiota. Advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology and bioinformatics have facilitated the characterization of human microbiota. Previous studies have shown that there is an alteration of ocular microbiota in inflammatory and autoimmune ocular diseases. The purpose of this review article is to evaluate the potential effect of ocular microbiota on the pathophysiology of keratoconus. Expert opinion: Recent studies have shown the low-level chronic inflammatory process in keratoconus. A regulatory interaction has been demonstrated between human microbiota and Toll-like receptors, which are innate immune system receptors. In addition, Toll-like receptor activity in keratoconus has been shown to be higher than in normal individuals. Therefore, the alteration of ocular microbiota may have a potential role in keratoconus etiopathogenesis.

In a systematic analysis of the comparative genomics, we tried to elucidate the genomic contents that account for the distinct host adaptability patterns of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species. The Bifidobacterium species, with species-level phylogenetic structures affected by recombination among strains, broad mucin-foraging activity, and dietary-fibre- degrading ability, represented niche conservatism and tended to be host-adapted. The Lactobacillus species stretched across three lifestyles, namely free-living, nomadic and host-adapted, as characterized by the variations of bacterial occurrence time, guanine-cytosine (GC) content and genome size, evolution event frequency, and the presence of human-adapted bacterial genes. The numbers and activity of host-adapted factors, such as bile salt hydrolase and intestinal tissue-anchored elements, were distinctly distributed among the three lifestyles. The strains of the three lifestyles could be separated with such a collection of colonization-related genomic content (genes, genome size and GC content). Thus, our work provided valuable information for rational selection and gut engraftment prediction of probiotics. Here, we have found many interesting predictive results for bacterial gut fitness, which will be validated in vitro and in vivo. © 2021 The Authors.",4.0

In this study, we selected four B. vulgatus strains (FTJS5K1, FTJS7K1, FSDTA11B14, and FSDLZ51K1) with different genomic characteristics and evaluated their protective roles against dextran sulfate sodium- (DSS-) induced colitis. Compared to the other three tested strains, B. vulgatus 7K1 more strongly ameliorated the DSS-induced weight loss, shortening of the colon length, increased disease activity index scores, colonic tissue injury, and immunomodulatory disorder. In contrast, B. vulgatus 51K1 significantly worsened the DSS-induced alterations in the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) concentration and colonic histopathology. A comparative genomic analysis of B. vulgatus 7K1 and 51K1 showed that the beneficial effects of B. vulgatus 7K1 may be associated with some of its specific genes involved in the production of short-chain fatty acids or capsular polysaccharides and enhancement of its survivability in the gut. In conclusion, these findings indicate that the supplementation of B. vulgatus 7K1 is a potentially efficacious intervention for alleviating colitis and provides scientific support for the screening of probiotics with anticolitis effect. © 2021 Sijia Li et al.",1.0

METHODS: We used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to examine the associations between gut microbiota and neurodevelopmental outcomes assessed by the Bayley Scales of Infant Development III in 71 full‐term healthy infants at 18 months of age. We hypothesized that children would differ in gut microbial diversity, enterotypes obtained by Dirichlet multinomial mixture analysis and specific taxa based on their behavioural characteristics. RESULTS: In children dichotomized by behavioural trait performance in above‐ and below‐median groups, weighted Unifrac b‐diversity exhibited significant differences in fine motor (FM) activity. Dirichlet multinomial mixture modelling identified two enterotypes strongly associated with FM outcomes. When controlling for maternal pre‐gestational BMI and breastfeeding for up to 3 months, the examination of signature taxa in FM groups showed that Turicibacter and Parab-acteroides were highly abundant in the below‐median FM group, while Collinsella, Coprococcus, En-terococcus, Fusobacterium, Holdemanella, Propionibacterium, Roseburia, Veillonella, an unassigned genus within Veillonellaceae and, interestingly, probiotic Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus were more abundant in the above‐median FM group. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest an association between enterotypes and specific genera with FM activity and may represent an opportunity for probiotic interventions relevant to treatment for motor disorders. © 2021 by the authors.

The aim of this study was to determine whether WD, PHGG and inulin or NCFM and HN019 alone generate a more favourable gut bacterial community than when combined. A secondary aim was to assess organic acid production following prebiotics, probiotics and synbiotic fermentation. An in vitro gut model batch culture fermentation was run for 72 h. Samples were collected for bacterial enumeration (fluorescent in situ hybridisation combined with flow cytometry) and organic acid production (gas chromatography). Inulin and HN019 combination significantly increased bifidobacteria compared to inulin alone. Additionally, a significant increase in lactic acid bacteria, Bacteroides and Clostridium coccoides–Eubacterium rectale was found in the inulin containing probiotic vessels. The WD and PHGG vessels combined with the probiotic did not show any alteration in bacterial metabolism compared to the dietary fibres alone. In conclusion, synbiotic inulin combined with either HN019 or NCFM may help to enhance bacterial metabolites and cross-feeding to lead to a prolonged elevation in Bifidobacterium spp., and lactic acid bacteria.

However, the global distinct and identical features of mother–infant gut microbiota at various taxonomic resolutions and metabolic functions across cohorts and potential of infant microbial prediction based on their paired mother’s gut microbiota remain unclear. Here, we analyzed 376 mother–infant dyads (468 mother and 1024 infant samples) of eight studies from six countries and observed higher diversity at species and strain levels in maternal gut microbiota but not their metabolic functions. A number of 290 species were shared in at least one mother–infant dyad, with 26 species (five at strain level) observed across cohorts. The profile of mother–infant shared species and strains was further influenced by delivery mode and feeding regimen. The mother-sourced species in infants exhibited similar strain heterogeneity but more metabolic functions compared to other-sourced species, suggesting the comparable stability and fitness of shared and non-shared species and the potential role of shared species in the early gut microbial community, respectively. Predictive models showed moderate performance accuracy for shared species and strains occurrences in infants. These generalized mother–infant shared species and strains may be considered as the primary targets for future work toward infant microbiome development and probiotics exploration. © 2021 The Author(s).

A total of 108 one-day-old male broiler chicks (Ross 308) were randomly allotted to one of three treatments. Each treatment was distributed into six replicate cages with six birds each. The treatments consisted of a basal diet without treatment (NC), basal diet plus coccidial challenge (PC), and basal diet plus the coccidial challenge and 1 g/kg of fermented products (FP). The results indicated that FP increased the average daily gain of broilers at 21 to 35 days of age compared with the PC group (p < 0.05). The anti-coccidia index in the FP group was elevated compared with the PC group (p < 0.05). Principal coordinate analysis showed significant segregation in bacterial community composition in the cecal digesta among the groups. The genus Lactobacillus was more abundant in the cecal digesta of the FP group compared with the PC group (p < 0.05). There was a positive correlation between the abundance of the genus Lactobacillus in the cecal digesta and growth performance (body weight, average daily gain, and average feed intake). Furthermore, the abundance of the genus Lactobacillus in the cecal digesta was positively associated with the cecal short-chain fatty acid levels (formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, and isobutyric acid). These findings suggest that fermented products produced by B. licheniformis can ameliorate the average daily gain of broilers exposed to coccidial challenge. B. licheniformis-fermented product supplementation increases anti-coccidial activity and modulates gut microbiota composition by increasing beneficial microbes and decreasing harmful microbes in broilers under coccidial challenge. © 2021 by the authors.

While anorexia nervosa (AN) pathophysiology is not entirely clear, it is presumably linked to microbiome dysbiosis. We aimed to elucidate the gut microbiota contribution in AN disease pathophysiology. We analyzed the composition and diversity of the gut microbiome of patients with AN (bacteriome and mycobiome) from stool samples before and after renourishment, and compared them to healthy controls. Further, levels of assorted neurotransmitters and short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) were analyzed in stool samples by MS and NMR, respectively. Biochemical, anthropometric, and psychometric profiles were assessed. The bacterial alpha-diversity parameter analyses revealed only increased Chao 1 index in patients with AN before the realimentation, reflecting their interindividual variation. Subsequently, core microbiota depletion signs were observed in patients with AN. Overrepresented OTUs (operation taxonomic units) in patients with AN taxonomically belonged to Alistipes, Clostridiales, Christensenellaceae, and Ruminococcaceae. Underrepresented OTUs in patients with AN were Faecalibacterium, Agathobacter, Bacteroides, Blautia, and Lachnospira. Patients exhibited greater interindividual variation in the gut bacteriome, as well as in metagenome content compared to controls, suggesting altered bacteriome functions. Patients had decreased levels of serotonin, GABA, dopamine, butyrate, and acetate in their stool samples compared to controls. Mycobiome analysis did not reveal significant differences in alpha diversity and fungal profile composition between patients with AN and healthy controls, nor any correlation of the fungal composition with the bacterial profile. Our results show the changed profile of the gut microbiome and its metabolites in patients with severe AN. Although therapeutic partial renourishment led to increased body mass index and improved psychometric parameters, SCFA, and neurotransmitter profiles, as well as microbial community compositions, did not change substantially during the hospitalization period, which can be potentially caused by only partial weight recovery. © 2021 The Author(s).

While the intestinal microbiome significantly influences human health and disease. This research aimed to investigate and characterize the relative abundance of intestinal bacterial composition in esophageal cancer patients. The fecal samples were collected from esophageal cancer patients (n = 15) and healthy volunteers (n = 10). The PCR-DGGE was carried out by focusing on the V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene, and qPCR was performed for Bacteroides vulgatus, Escherichia coli, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium leptum and Lactobacillus. High-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene targeting the V3+V4 region was performed on 20 randomly selected samples. PCR-DGGE and High-throughput diversity results showed a significant alteration of gut bacterial composition between the experimental and control groups, which indicates the gut microbial dysbiosis in esophageal cancer patients. At the phylum level, there was significant enrichment of Bacteroidetes, while a non-significant decrease of Firmicutes in the experimental group. At family statistics, a significantly higher level of Bacteroidaceae and Enterobacteriaceae, while a significantly lower abundance of Prevotellaceae and Veillonellaceae were observed. There was a significantly high prevalence of genera Bacteroides, Escherichia-Shigella, while a significantly lower abundance of Prevotella_9 and Dialister in the experimental group as compared to the control group.

Probiotics are used to prevent disease and, when taken by the mother, they may affect infant microbiome as well as HBM. However, few studies have specifically investigated the effect of probiotic intake by the mother on HBM and infant microbiota at genus/species level. Therefore, we present a comprehensive analysis of paired HBM and infant feces (IF) microbiome samples before and after probiotic intake by HBM-producing mothers. Methods: Lactating mothers were administered with Lactobacillus rhamnosus (n = 9) or Saccharomyces boulardii capsules (n = 9), for 2 months; or no probiotic (n = 7). Paired HBM and IF samples were collected before and after treatment and analyzed by next-generation sequencing. Results: Forty-three HBM and 49 IF samples were collected and sequenced. Overall, in 43 HBM samples, 1,190 microbial species belonging to 684 genera, 245 families, 117 orders, and 56 classes were detected. In 49 IF samples, 372 microbial species belonging to 195 genera, 79 families, 42 orders, and 18 classes were identified. Eight of 20 most abundant genera in both HBM and IF samples overlapped: Streptococcus (14.42%), Lactobacillus, Staphylococcus, and Veillonella, which were highly abundant in the HBM samples; and Bifidobacterium (27.397%), Bacteroides, and Faecalibacterium, which were highly abundant in the IF samples. Several major bacterial genera and species were detected in the HBM and IF samples after probiotic treatment, illustrating complex changes in the microbiomes upon treatment. Conclusion: This is the first Korean microbiome study in which the effect of different probiotic intake by the mother on the microbiota in HBM and IF samples was investigated.

However, information on the influence of B. bifidum on gut microbial diversity of treated and pretreated IBD patients is limited. Material/Methods: Our study investigated therapeutic and preventive effects of B. bifidum ATCC 29521 on C57BL/6 mice with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced acute colitis via 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) gene sequencing. Results: Treatment and pretreatment of mice with B. bifidum ATCC 29521 significantly alleviated the severity of acute colitis on the basis of clinical and pathologic indicators. 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed that administration of B. bifidum shifted composition of the gut microbiome in mice with DSS-induced colitis in both treated and pretreated groups. Mice pretreated with B. bifidum ATCC 29521 for 21 days exhibited a significant increase in diversity of the gut microbiome. Principal coordinate analysis showed that gut microbiota structure was shaped by different treatments and time points. On the basis of linear discriminant analysis of effect size, the abundance of the genus Escherichia-Shigella, belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae, was reduced in the B. bifidum-treated group, indicating that pathogens were inhibited by the B. bifidum treatment. Furthermore, the genera Intestinimonas and Bacteroides were significantly associated with the B. bifidum-pretreated group.

This systematic review based on the PICO strategy searching into PubMed, EMBASE, PsychINFO, and Cochrane Library examined the literature on the role of altered microbiota in the pathogenesis and treatment of EDs. Results. Sixteen studies were included, mostly regarding AN. Alpha diversity and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) levels were lower in patients with AN, and affective symptoms and ED psychopathology seem related to changes in gut microbiota. Microbiota-derived proteins stimulated the autoimmune system, altering neuroendocrine control of mood and satiety in EDs. Microbial richness increased in AN after weight regain on fecal microbiota transplantation. Conclusions. Microbiota homeostasis seems essential for a healthy communication network between gut and brain. Dysbiosis may promote intestinal inflammation, alter gut permeability, and trigger immune reactions in the hunger/satiety regulation center contributing to the pathophysiological development of EDs. A restored microbial balance may be a possible treatment target for EDs. A better and more in-depth characterization of gut microbiota and gut-brain crosstalk is required. Future studies may deepen the therapeutic and preventive role of microbiota in EDs. © The Author(s), 2020. Published by Cambridge University Press on behalf of European Psychiatry Association.

Most patients from the first cluster had an epidemiological connection to the Wuhan's Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. Available evidence has shown that SARSCoV- 2 can be easily transmitted from person to person through close contact and respiratory droplets, posing a substantial challenge to public health. At present, the research on SARS-CoV-2 is still in the primary stages. However, dexamethasone and remdesivir are appeared to be promising medical therapies. Still, there is no definite specific treatment, and the mainstay of treatment is still focused on supportive therapies. Currently, over 150 vaccines are under investigation. It is necessary to understand the nature of the virus and its clinical characteristics in order to find effectively manage the disease. The knowledge about this virus is rapidly evolving, and clinicians must update themselves regularly.

"Girard M., Tretola M., Bee G.",A single dose of synbiotics and vitamins at birth affects piglet microbiota before weaning and modifies post-weaning performance,2021,Animals,10.3390/ani11010084,"Early-life microbial colonization is an important driver for the development and maturation of the gut. The present study aimed to determine whether a single-dose supplement given only at birth would improve piglet performance and modify their fecal microbiota during the suckling and post-weaning periods. At birth, piglets from eight litters received a supplement (SUP+) while piglets from six other litters received water (SUP−). All piglets were monitored until two weeks post-weaning, and fecal samples were collected on Day 16 of age and two weeks post-weaning (Day 39 ± 1). The supplementation resulted in an improvement of average daily gain during the whole experimental period, mainly due to a better growth and a reduction in the incidence of diarrhea in the post-weaning period. There were no differences in the abundance and diversity of the main taxa, although the supplementation increased the relative abundance of rare taxa, such as bacteria from the Saccharibacteria and Cyanobacteria phyla, and the Lentisphaeria class in the suckling period. In addition, at 16 days of age, SUP+ piglets had a more diverse core microbiota, with bacteria from the Lactobacillus genus being present in the core microbiota of SUP+ piglets and absent from SUP− piglets. Therefore, the enhanced growth performance and reduction in diarrhea seem to be related to changes in fecal microbiota during the suckling period rather than at two weeks post-weaning. © 2021 by the authors.

Methods: To evaluate the preventative effect of Lactobacillus-based probiotics on IAH-induced intestinal barrier damages, a single-species probiotics (L92) and a multispecies probiotics (VSL#3) were introduced orally to Sprague-Dawley rats for 7 days before inducing IAH. The intestinal histology and permeability to macromolecules (fluoresceine isothiocyanate, FITC-dextran, N ¼ 8 for each group), the parameters of immunomodulatory and oxidative responses [monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1), interleukin-1b (IL-1b), interleukin-4 (IL-4), interleukin-10 (IL-10), malonaldehyde, glutathione peroxidase (GSH- Px), catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase; N ¼ 4 for each group], and the microbiome profiling (N ¼ 4 for each group) were analyzed. Results: Seven-day pretreatments of L92 significantly alleviated the IAH-induced increase in intestinal permeability to FITC-dextran and histological damage (P < 0.0001), accompanied with the suppression of inflammatory and oxidative activation. The increase of MCP-1 and IL-1b was significantly inhibited (P < 0.05); the anti-inflammatory cytokines, IL-4, and IL-10 were maintained at high levels; and the suppression of CAT (P < 0.05) was significantly reversed when pretreated with L92. On the contrary, no significant protective effects were observed in the VSL#3-pretreated group. Among the 84 identified species, 260 MetaCyc pathways, and 217 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, the protective effects of L92 were correlated with an increased relative abundance of Bacteroides finegoldii, Odoribacter splanchnicus, and the global activation of amino acid biosynthesis pathways, especially the glutamate–glutamine biosynthesis pathway. Conclusions: Seven-day pretreatment with a single-species probiotics can prevent IAH-induced severe intestinal barrier dysfunction, potentially through microbial modulation.

In this study, intestinal cell apoptosis was first observed in the β-conglycinin (β-CG) allergy model, and the effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) on reducing apoptosis of cells in the intestine and its underlying mechanisms were further investigated. Allergic mice received oral LGG daily, and intestinal tissue apoptotic cells, gut microbiota, and metabolites were evaluated six and nine days after intervention. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) analysis revealed that LGG intervention could reduce the incidence of cell apoptosis more effectively than natural recovery (NR). The results of 16S rRNA analysis indicated that LGG intervention led to an increase in the relative abundance of Bacteroides. Metabolite analysis of intestinal contents indicated that histamine, N-acetylhistamine, N(α)-γ-glutamylhistamine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, arachidonic acid malate, and xanthine were significantly decreased, and deoxycholic acid, lithocholic acid were significantly increased after the LGG intervention on β-CG allergy; the decreases in histamine and N(α)-γ-glutamylhistamine were significant compared with those of NR. In conclusion, LGG reduces apoptosis of cells induced by β-CG allergy, which may be related to regulation of Bacteroides and the bile secretion pathway. © 2020 by the authors.

For people living in the extremes of a plateau climate, lack of oxygen is a primary health challenge that leads to a series of reactions. We wondered how intestinal microorganisms might change in a simulated plateau environment and what changes might occur in the host organism and intestinal microorganisms in the absence of hypoxia-related factors. In this study, mice carrying a knockout of hypoxia-inducible factor 1β (Hif-1β) in myeloid cells and wild-type mice were raised in a composite hypoxic chamber to simulate a plateau environment at 5,000 m of elevation for 14 days. The mice carrying the myeloid Hif-1β deletion displayed aggravated hypoxic phenotypes in comparison to and significantly greater weight loss and significantly higher cardiac index values than the wild-type group. The levels of some cytokines increased in the hypoxic environment. Analysis of 16S rRNA sequencing results showed that hypoxia had a significant effect on the gut microbiota in both wild-type and Hif-1β-deficient mice, especially on the first day. The levels of members of the Bacteroidaceae family increased continuously from day 1 to day 14 in Hif-1β deletion mice, and they represented an obviously different group of bacteria at day 14 compared with the wild-type mice. Butyrate-producing bacteria, such as Butyricicoccus, were found in wild-type mice only after 14 days in the hypoxic environment. In conclusion, hypoxia caused heart enlargement, greater weight loss, and obvious microbial imbalance in myeloid Hif-1β-deficient mice.

Modulating the composition of the intestinal flora may be a viable means of alleviating such inflammatory pathology. Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (B. thetaiotaomicron) is a symbiotic intestinal microbe that has been associated with IBD, although the mechanistic basis for this association remains to be clarified. In this present study, we determined that B. thetaiotaomicron can alleviate colonic inflammation through mechanisms associated with the modulation of tryptophan metabolism and T cell subsets within inflamed intestinal tissues. Specifically, we found that B. thetaiotaomicron promotes the preferential differentiation of anti-inflammatory Treg/Th2 cells while suppressing the relative differentiation of pro-inflammatory Th1/Th17 cells, thereby decreasing inflammation within the colon. At a molecular level, B. thetaiotaomicron treatment was linked to altered CpG methylation within the Foxp3 promoter that was associated with enhanced Treg cell functionality. In a murine dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) colitis model system, B. thetaiotaomicron increased the levels of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) ligands indole metabolites-indole acetic acid (IAA) and indole propionic acid (IPA), thereby increasing AHR activation that is related to changes of transcription factor expression profiles within T cells. In summary, our data suggest that B. thetaiotaomicron can activate AHR and modulate CD4+ T cell differentiation profiles in a murine DSS colitis model system, suggesting that this bacterium may be of therapeutic relevance for the treatment of IBD. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",11.0

However, the mechanisms underlying microbial-induced serotonin signaling are not well understood. Methods: Adult germ-free mice were treated with sterile media, live Bifidobacterium dentium, heat-killed B dentium, or live Bacteroides ovatus. Mouse and human enteroids were used to assess the effects of B dentium metabolites on 5-HT release from enterochromaffin cells. In vitro and in vivo short-chain fatty acids and 5-HT levels were assessed by mass spectrometry. Expression of tryptophan hydroxylase, short-chain fatty acid receptor free fatty acid receptor 2, 5-HT receptors, and the 5-HT re-uptake transporter (serotonin transporter) were assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunostaining. RNA in situ hybridization assessed 5-HT–receptor expression in the brain, and 5-HT–receptor–dependent behavior was evaluated using the marble burying test. Results: B dentium mono-associated mice showed increased fecal acetate. This finding corresponded with increased intestinal 5-HT concentrations and increased expression of 5-HT receptors 2a, 4, and serotonin transporter. These effects were absent in B ovatus-treated mice. Application of acetate and B dentium–secreted products stimulated 5-HT release in mouse and human enteroids. In situ hybridization of brain tissue also showed significantly increased hippocampal expression of 5-HT–receptor 2a in B dentium–treated mice relative to germ-free controls. Functionally, B dentium colonization normalized species-typical repetitive and anxiety-like behaviors previously shown to be linked to 5-HT–receptor 2a. Conclusions: These data suggest that B dentium, and the bacterial metabolite acetate, are capable of regulating key components of the serotonergic system in multiple host tissues, and are associated with a functional change in adult behavior. © 2020 The Authors",23.0

Increasing evidence has indicated that Bacteroides vulgatus has potential as a probiotic for ameliorating postmenopausal bone loss. In this study, ovariectomized female C57/BL6 mice were treated with B. vulgatus ATCC 8482 gavage to investigate the differences in colonic microbiota composition, inflammation signal pathways, inflammatory cytokines, bone turnover markers, and lumbar vertebrae microstructure compared with the control group. Our results show that B. vulgatus ATCC 8482 diminished microbiota dysbiosis and subsequently down-regulated the colonic lipopolysaccharide/TLR-4/p-NF-κB pathway leading to decreased serum TNF-α. This reduced TNF-α/RANKL expression and induced ALP and Runx-2 expression in the 5th lumbar vertebra, leading to amelioration of bone loss and microstructure destruction in the lumbar vertebra of ovariectomized mice. Taken together, these results indicate that B. vulgatus could be a probiotic for treatment of postmenopausal lumbar osteoporosis. © 2020",3.0

Gut microbiota has been reported to be closely related to human health. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of lead exposure on the composition of gut microbiota. The composition of gut microbiota alteration was detected by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, following a 42-day exposure of lead (1 mg/L). The results showed that compared with the normal control group, the carp of lead group showed severe intestinal tissues injury and decreased Zona Occludens 1 (ZO-1) and occludin expression. The production of LPS in serum was increased by the treatment of lead exposure. Our results showed gut bacterial diversity in lead-treated common carp was lower than the control group. At the phylum level, the abundance of Bacteroidetes (LPS producing bacteria) and Fusobacteria in lead-treated carp were much higher than the control carp. And the abundance of Actinobacteria decreased by lead exposure. At the genus level, we found the abundance of Bacteroides (LPS producing bacteria) and Plesiomonas (an important pathogenic bacteria), increased significantly by lead exposure. And the abundance of Akkermansia, a critical probiotics, was markedly inhibited by lead exposure.

Methods: A laparotomy with cecal manipulation was performed to induce POI in guinea pigs. Fecal pellets were collected before the operation (the baseline) and 1, 3, and 5 days after the operation. The extracted fecal DNA was amplified and sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq sequencing system. The same POI procedures were performed after oral pretreatment of the probiotics for 7 days before operation. The effect of the probiotics on the selected taxa and fecal acetate were evaluated, as were the butyrate levels. The colonic transit was assessed by measurement of the fecal pellet output. Key Results: The communities of the baseline and POI groups indicated significantly distinct composition. The genera Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus were more abundant in the baseline group compared with the POI groups, and Bacteroides and Blautia were more abundant in the POI groups. Decreased abundances of the species Bifidobacterium bifidum and Bifidobacterium longum after the POI procedure were significantly increased in the probiotics group. The decreased fecal butyrate level after the POI procedure was significantly increased, and colonic transit was significantly improved in the probiotics group. Conclusions and Inferences: POI induces gut bacterial dysbiosis. Moreover, pretreatment of probiotics before operation restores the beneficial bacterial species, butyrate production, and bowel movement. The modulation of gut microbiota may help the treatment and prevention of POI. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",3.0

The extent to which these factors influence the microbiota is relatively unknown. The primary objective of this paper was to investigate the effect of a probiotic on gut microbiota and IBS symptoms. The secondary objective was exploring correlations between dietary intake and gut microbiota. Design: This study was an extension of a randomised clinical trial (Clinical Trials Registry NCT018867810). Dietary intake was recorded by three-day estimated food records. Faecal samples were collected at three time points: (1) baseline (A), (2) after eight weeks’ probiotic supplementation (Lactobacillus plantarum 299v) (B) and (3) following a two-week washout period (C). Total Bacteroides spp., Bifidobacteria bifidum and Lactobacillus plantarum were quantified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Results: Twenty-eight diarrhoea-predominant IBS (D-IBS) and 24 constipation-predominant IBS (C-IBS) patients participated. Lactobacillus plantarum profiles at baseline (A) were significantly different between C-IBS and D-IBS (−0.956 ± 1.239 vs. −1.700 ± 1.239; p = 0.024). There was no significant change in bacterial counts after completion of the trial (B) and following the washout period (C) between groups. In both groups there were significant direct correlations between fibre and Lactobacillus plantarum and inverse correlations between fibre and Bacteroides spp. There was no difference in symptom severity scores between treatment and placebo groups during the study. Conclusion: The probiotic had no effect on symptoms and GIT microbiota. Certain nutrients strongly correlate to certain bacterial profiles, suggesting that nutrients can significantly influence gastrointestinal microbiota composition. © 2019 The Author(s).

This study aimed to characterize the bacterial communities in human milk, maternal, and infant feces in a small yet very homogeneous cohort of 25 healthy mother–infant pairs in northwestern China (n = 25, infant age from 7 days to 2 years), with special emphasis on the cooccurrence and vertical transfer of Lactobacillus phylotypes at the species or strain level in mother-breast milk-infant triads. Accurate sequencing analysis revealed that among 73 Lactobacillus zero-radius operational classification units (ZOTUs) identified, 58 belonging to 18 recognized species or species groups were distributed in all three types of samples. Lactobacillus ruminis, L. mucosae and L. gasseri-johnsonii as true residents were the most represented in all three ecosystems, whereas the content of Lactobacillus phylotypes commonly developed as probiotics was not dominant. While the numbers of Lactobacillus species in breast milk and infant feces were greater than that in maternal feces, principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) based on beta diversity, coupled with the frequency of isolates determined by culture methods, showed that the Lactobacillus community in the infant gut was more similar to that in the maternal gut than to that in breast milk, suggesting that the gut is niche selective for Lactobacillus populations. In addition, identical strains of L. ruminis, L. paracasei, L. mucosae and L. salivarius were isolated from multiple mother–infant pairs, supporting the hypothesis that vertical transfer of bacteria via breastfeeding contributes to the initial establishment of the microbiota in the developing infant intestine. © Copyright © 2020 Zhang, Mushajiang, Luo, Tian, Ni and Yan.",9.0

In the present study, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) ATCC 53103 was used to treat BALB/c mice. After LGG intervention, both low and high LGG doses were shown to improve the observed OTU, Chao1, ACE, and Shannon indices, while the Simpson index decreased, demonstrating that LGG can promote intestinal microbiota abundance and diversity. Furthermore, LGG treatment increased the abundances of intestinal Firmicutes, Bacteroides and Actinomycetes while reducing that of Proteobacteria. In addition to its effect on gut the microbiota, LGG could also regulate the host immune system. In the present study, we showed that LGG could affect the percentage of CD3+ T lymphocytes in the spleens (SPLs), mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs), Peyer’s patches (PPs) and lamina propria lymphocytes (LPLs) of mice, including total CD3+ T, CD3+CD4+ T, and CD3+CD8+ T lymphocytes. Furthermore, LGG could effectively increase the expression of Th1-type cytokines (IFN-γ) and Th2 cytokines (IL-4) in CD4+ T cells, indicating that the proportion of Th1 and Th2 cells in mice with LGG treatment was in a high equilibrium state compared to the control group. In addition, the IFN-γ/IL-4 ratio was greater than 1 in mice with LGG intervention, suggesting that LGG tends to mediate the Th1 immune response. The results of the present study also showed that LGG upregulated the expression of IL-17 in CD4+ T cells and regulated the percentage of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Treg cells in various secondary immunological organs, indicating that LGG may promote the balance of Th-17 and Treg cells. © Copyright © 2020 Shi, Cheng, Yang, Lu, Yin, Zeng, Wang, Jiang, Yang, Wang, Zhao, Huang, Ye, Cao, Yang and Wang.",9.0

Using in vitro fermentation, we analyzed the air pressure, pH-value, and short-chain fatty acid levels. We also performed 16S rRNA gene and metagenomic sequencing. A Venn diagram analysis revealed that 80% of the core operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were shared among the samples, and most of the xylooligosaccharide treatment core OTUs (319/333 OTUs) were shared with the other two treatments’ core OTUs. A significant difference analysis revealed that the relative abundance of Dorea, Bilophila, and Sulfurovum in wheat bran treatment was higher than that in xylan and xylooligosaccharide treatments. The clusters of orthologous groups of proteins functional composition of all samples was similar to the microbiota composition of the control. Using metagenomic sequencing, we revealed seven genes containing the conserved residues, Gly-X-Ser-X-Gly, and the catalytic triad, Ser-His-Asp, which are thus potential ferulic acid esterase genes.

Then, lipid accumulation and mRNA expression levels in the liver and the composition and metabolites of the gut microbiota were evaluated. Dietary APP attenuated liver steatosis in part through the enhancement and suppression of gene expression involved in liver fatty acid oxidation and synthesis, respectively. The enhancement of liver peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha mRNA expression level by APP consumption may be partly due to the high acetic acid content in cecal contents. Moreover, APP consumption modified the structure of the microbiota and high relative abundance of probiotic bacteria and low relative abundances of Bacteroides and Blautia in cecal content.

DNA was isolated from fecal samples, and 16S rRNA gene sequences were analyzed. SCFAs in stool were analyzed from patients with a single allergy (N = 84) and controls (N = 31). Results: The gut microbiota composition of allergic patients was significantly different compared to age-matched controls both in α-diversity and β-diversity. Distinct microbial signatures were noted for FA to different foods. Prevotella copri (P. copri) was the most overrepresented species in non-allergic controls. SCFAs levels were significantly higher in the non-allergic compared to the FA groups, whereas P. copri significantly correlated with all three SCFAs. We used these microbial differences to distinguish between FA patients and non-allergic healthy controls with an area under the curve of 0.90, and for the classification of FA patients according to their FA types using a supervised learning algorithm. Bacteroides and P. copri were identified as taxa potentially contributing to KEGG acetate-related pathways enriched in non-allergic compared to FA. In addition, overall pathway dissimilarities were found among different FAs. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate a link between IgE-mediated FA and the composition and metabolic activity of the gut microbiota. © 2020, The Author(s).",14.0

This study aimed to determine the presence and abundance of Akkermansia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who underwent washed microbiota transplantation (WMT) in order to elucidate the relationship between its level and patients’ clinical data and outcomes. A cohort of Chinese volunteers including 80 healthy controls (HC), 43 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), and 57 patients with Crohn’s disease (CD) were recruited. Akkermansia presented a low colonization rate of 48.8% and a relative abundance of 0.07% in a healthy Chinese population. Compared with HC, significantly lower colonization and abundance of Akkermansia were found in UC and CD (p < 0.01, p < 0.001, respectively). The combination of Akkermansia and twelve other gut commensal bacteria significantly enriched in healthy individuals could be conductive to discriminate IBD from HC. Co-occurrence of Akkermansia-Faecalibacterium prausnitzii was at a lower level in IBD. Patients’ age could affect the abundance of Akkermansia in CD. After WMT, 53.7% of patients achieved clinical response, and the colonization rate of Akkermansia increased significantly than that pre-WMT (p < 0.01). There was a positive correlation between patients and donors in the abundance of Akkermansia after WMT. Different from Europeans, the healthy Chinese population is characterized by a low presence of intestinal Akkermansia. Compared with healthy people, its colonization and abundance in IBD decreased more significantly. The efficacy of WMT for IBD was closely correlated with Akkermansia. ClinicalTrials.gov, pooled registered trials, NCT01790061, NCT01793831. Registered February 13, 2013, 18 February 2013. Key points: • Akkermansia showed a lower colonization and abundance in Chinese than Europeans. • Akkermansia could distinguish IBD from healthy people with a reduced abundance. • IBD patients achieved response from WMT through an increased Akkermansia level.

However, the impact of antibiotics on gut microbiota during long-term antibiotic-free and antibiotic breeding at porcine-fattening phase have not been studied extensively so far. Here, we conducted a systematic 16S rRNA gene sequencing-based study combined with metagenomic analysis to reveal the variation of diversity and function of gut microbiota between antibiotic-free (treatment group, TG) and antibiotic (a mixture of flavomycin and enramycin, control group, CG) breeding at various stages of fattening pigs. In the present study, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria phyla were the core microbiomes in fattening pig gut microbiota. The ratio between Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes significantly increased with age (P = 0.03). TG showed significantly higher relative abundance of Proteobacteria and Fibrobacteres phyla than CG. The microbial community can be divided into several notably clustered blocks based on cooperative and competitive correlations. These blocks centered on numerous special genera, which play essential roles in body development and disease prevention. TG showed obviously higher proportions of metabolic pathways related to metabolism, endocrine system, nervous system and excretory system, but pathways included carbohydrate metabolism and immune system diseases in CG. Collectively, this study has comprehensively demonstrated microbial diversities, differences and correlations among gut microbiota, microbial metabolism and gene functions during long-term antibiotic-free breeding.

However, the underlying mechanism of how specific gut bacteria contribute to faecal LPS levels remains unclear. We retrospectively analysed the data of 92 patients and found that the abundance of the genus Bacteroides was significantly and negatively correlated with faecal LPS levels. The controls showed a higher abundance of Bacteroides than that in the patients with CVD. The endotoxin units of the Bacteroides LPS, as determined by the limulus amoebocyte lysate (LAL) tests, were drastically lower than those of the Escherichia coli LPS; similarly, the Bacteroides LPS induced relatively low levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine production and did not induce sepsis in mice. Fermenting patient faecal samples in a single-batch fermentation system with Bacteroides probiotics led to a significant increase in the Bacteroides abundance, suggesting that the human gut microbiota could be manipulated toward decreasing the faecal LPS levels. In the clinical perspective, Bacteroides decrease faecal LPS levels because of their reduced LAL activity; therefore, increasing Bacteroides abundance might serve as a novel therapeutic approach to prevent CVD via reducing faecal LPS levels and suppressing immune responses. © 2020, The Author(s).",12.0

In this study, we sought to examine the possible mechanisms for how Bifidobacterium bifidum (B.b.) and Bacteroides fragilis (B.f.) influence EGC regulation. In this study, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) were used as exogenous stimuli of EGCs to establish an intestinal inflammation model. After stimulation with LPS and IFN-γ, B.b. and B.f. supernatants were used to activate EGCs and to examine EGC immune mechanisms. For this purpose, qRT-PCR, western blotting, and laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) were used to detect the expression of NLRP3, NLRP6, NGF, NT-3, IL-18, IL-1β, and caspase-1. We found that EGCs, after stimulation with LPS and IFN-γ, could express NLRP3, NLRP6, NT-3, NGF, IL-18, IL-1β, and caspase-1 through LSCM. In intestinal inflammation, B.b. and B.f. could trigger an increase in NGF and NT-3 expression in EGCs in order to protect the intestine. Furthermore, B.b. and B.f. could upregulate NLRP3 expression in EGCs and promote an inflammatory response. B.b. had a dual regulatory role in EGC NLRP6 expression, while B.f. inhibited NLRP6 protein expression. Moreover, B.b. could decrease the expression of IL-18, IL-1β, and caspase-1 in EGCs in order to inhibit the inflammatory response. Contrary to this, B.f. could upregulate IL-18, IL-1β, and caspase-1 expression in EGCs in order to promote the inflammatory response.

Our understanding of ecological principles that govern the dynamics and resilience of this highly complex ecosystem remains rudimentary. This knowledge gap becomes more problematic as new approaches to modifying this ecosystem, such as fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), are being developed as therapeutic interventions. Here we present an ecological framework to understand the efficacy of FMT in treating conditions associated with a disrupted gut microbiota, using the recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection as a prototype disease. This framework predicts several key factors that determine the efficacy of FMT. Moreover, it offers an efficient algorithm for the rational design of personalized probiotic cocktails to decolonize pathogens. We analyze data from both preclinical mouse experiments and a clinical trial of FMT to validate our theoretical framework. The presented results significantly improve our understanding of the ecological principles of FMT and have a positive translational impact on the rational design of general microbiota-based therapeutics. © 2020, The Author(s).",14.0

This study examined the effects of a probiotic (PROB) or probiotic/prebiotic/essential oil supplement (PPEO) during a subclinical NE challenge. On day (d) of hatch, 960 male broilers were randomized to four groups (8 pens/treatment, 30 birds/pen) including (1) negative control (NC): corn-soybean meal diet; (2) positive control (PC): NC + 20 g Virginiamycin/ton diet; (3) NC + 227 g PROB/ton diet; and (4) NC + 453 g PPEO/ton diet. One d after placement, birds were challenged by a coccidia vaccine to induce NE. Feed intake and body weights were measured on d 8 (NE onset) and end of each feeding period. On d 8, the small intestines of three birds/pen were examined for NE lesions. Jejunum samples and ileal mucosal scrapings from one bird/pen were respectively collected to measure mRNA abundance (d 8 and d 14) and profile the microbiota (d 8 and d 42). Data were analyzed in JMP or QIIME 2 and significance between treatments identified by LSD (P < 0.05). PROB and PPEO had significantly lower mortality (d 0–14) and NE lesion scores compared to NC. Feed conversion ratio was significantly lower in PC, PROB, and PPEO, while average daily gain was higher in PPEO and PC groups compared to NC from d 0–42. On d 8 and d 14, mRNA abundance of claudin-3 was higher in PPEO compared to NC. On d 14, compared to NC, mRNA abundance of sIgA and PGC-1α in PROB and PPEO were lower and higher, respectively. Compared to NC, PPEO increased mTOR abundance on d 14. On d 8, relative abundance of Clostridium sensu stricto 1, Ruminiclostridium9, Prevotellaceae, Prevotellaceae UCG-014, ASF356, and Muribaculaceae was higher in NC compared to PPEO and PROB, while Lactobacillus was lower in NC. Escherichia-Shigella had higher abundance in PC compared to PPEO and PROB. Collectively, these data indicate that during a subclinical naturally occurring NE, supplementation of PROB or PPEO supports performance and reduces intestinal lesions, potentially through modifying tight junction proteins, gut microbiota, immune responses, and cell metabolism. © Copyright © 2020 Emami, Calik, White, Kimminau and Dalloul.",10.0

RSM was processed enzymatically by a cellulase (CELL), two pectinases (PECT), or chemically by an alkaline (ALK) treatment. 16S rRNA gene sequencing data was performed to evaluate changes in the gut microbiota composition, whereas short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production (ion-chromatography) and non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) composition (using monoclonal antibodies; mAbs) were used to assess fiber degradation. The results showed that ALK, CELL, PECT1, and PECT2 changed microbial community composition, increased the predicted abundance of microbial fiber-degrading enzymes and pathways, and increased acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, and total SCFA production. The increased microbial genera positively correlated with SCFA production. Monoclonal antibody analyses showed that the cell wall polysaccharide structures of RSM shifted after ALK, CELL, PECT1, and PECT2 treatment. The degradation of NSP during the fermentation period was dynamic, and not continuous based on the epitope recognition by mAbs. This study provides the first detailed analysis of changes in the swine intestinal microbiota due to RSM modified by ALK, CELL, PECT1, and PECT2, which altered the microbial community structure, shifted the predicted functional metagenomic profile and subsequently increased total SCFA production. Our findings that ALK, CELL, PECT1, and PECT2 increased fiber degradability in RSM could help guide feed additive strategies to improve efficiency and productivity in swine industry. The current study gave insight into how enzymatic treatment of feed can alter microbial communities, which provides good opportunity to develop novel carbohydrase treatments, particularly in swine feed. © Copyright © 2020 Long and Venema.",1.0

A decreased abundance of Odoribacter has been linked to different microbiota-associated diseases, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, cystic fibrosis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The type strain of O. splanchnicus has been genome-sequenced, but otherwise very little is known about this anaerobic bacterium. The species surfaces in many microbiota studies and, consequently, comprehension on its interactions with the host is needed. In this study, we isolated a novel strain of O. splanchnicus from a healthy fecal donor, identified it by genome sequencing and addressed its adhesive, epithelium reinforcing and immunoregulatory properties. Our results show that O. splanchnicus strain 57 is non-adherent to enterocytes or mucus, does not reinforce nor compromise Caco-2 monolayer integrity and most likely harbors penta-acylated, less endotoxic lipid A as part of its lipopolysaccharide (LPS) structure based on the lack of gene lpxM and in vitro results on low-level NF-κB activity. The studies by transmission electron microscopy revealed that O. splanchnicus produces outer membrane vesicles (OMV). O. splanchnicus cells, culture supernatant i.e., spent medium or OMVs did not induce interleukin-8 (IL-8) response in HT-29 enterocyte cells suggesting a very low proinflammatory capacity. On the contrary, the treatment of HT-29 cells with O. splanchnicus cells, spent medium or OMVs prior to exposure to Escherichia coli LPS elicited a significant decrease in IL-8 production as compared to E. coli LPS treatment alone. Moreover, O. splanchnicus spent supernatant induced IL-10 production by immune cells, suggesting anti-inflammatory activity. Our in vitro findings indicate that O. splanchnicus and its effector molecules transported in OMVs could potentially exert anti-inflammatory action in the gut epithelium. Taken together, O. splanchnicus seems to be a commensal with a primarily beneficial interaction with the host. © Copyright © 2020 Hiippala, Barreto, Burrello, Diaz-Basabe, Suutarinen, Kainulainen, Bowers, Lemmer, Engelthaler, Eklund, Facciotti and Satokari.",15.0

The macromolecules are well known for their immune-modulatory activity; however, how the human gut bacteria digest them is vaguely understood. In this study, Bacteroides uniformis JCM 13288 T was found to grow on laminarin, pustulan, and porphyran. We sequenced the genome of the strain, which was about 5.05 megabase pairs and contained 4868 protein-coding genes. On the basis of growth patterns of the bacterium, two putative polysaccharide utilization loci for β-glucans were identified from the genome, and associated four putative genes were cloned, expressed, purified, and characterized. Three glycoside hydrolases (GHs) that were endo-acting enzymes (BuGH16, BuGH30, and BuGH158), and one which was an exo-acting (BuGH3) enzyme. The BuGH3, BuGH16, and BuGH158 can cleave linear exo/endo- β- 1-3 linkages while BuGH30 can digest endo- β- 1-6 linkages. BuGH30 and BuGH158 were further explored for their roles in digesting β- glucans and generation of oligosaccharides, respectively. The BuGH30 predominately found to cleave long chain β- 1-6 linked glucans, and obtained final product was gentiobiose. The BuGH158 used for producing oligosaccharides varying from degree of polymerization 2 to 7 from soluble curdlan. We demonstrated that these oligosaccharides can be utilized by gut bacteria, which either did not grow or poorly grew on laminarin. Thus, B. uniformis JCM 13288 T is not only capable of utilizing β-glucans but also shares these glycans with human gut bacteria for potentially maintaining the gut microbial homeostasis. © 2020 The Author(s).

This study has undertaken to understand the microbiota profile of healthy Southeast Asian mother-infant pairs. Here, we examined the fecal, vaginal and breast milk microbiota of Indonesian mothers and the fecal microbiota of their children from less than 1 month to 48 months old. To determine the immune status of children and the effect of diet at different ages, we examined the level of cytokines, bile acids in the fecal water and weaning food frequency. The fecal microbiota of the children before weaning contained mainly Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium, which presented at low abundance in the samples of mothers. After weaning, the fecal microbiome of children was mainly of the Prevotella type, with decreasing levels of Bifidobacterium, thus becoming more like the fecal microbiome of the mother. The abundance of infant fecal commensals generally correlated inversely with potential pathogens before weaning. The fecal Bifidobacterium in children correlated inversely with the consumption of complex carbohydrates and fruits after weaning. The specific cytokines related to the proliferation and maturation of immunity were found to increase after weaning. A decreasing level of primary bile acids and an increase of secondary bile acids were observed after weaning. This study highlights the change in the GI microbiota of infants to adult-type microbiota after weaning and identifies diet as a major contributing factor. © 2020 The Author(s).

However, it is still unclear whether a particular probiotic strain will have similar beneficial effects on healthy adults from different regions. In this study, the probiotic Lactobacillus casei Zhang (LCZ) was consumed by healthy adults from six different Asian regions and the changes in gut microbiota were compared using PacBio single molecule, real-time (SMRT) sequencing technology based on samples collected before, during and after consumption of LCZ. Our results reveal that the effect of LCZ consumption on individuals was closely related to the composition of that individual’s basal gut microbiota. A Gut Microbiota Variability Index (GMVI) was proposed to quantitatively compare the effects of LCZ on human gut microecology. Subjects from Xinjiang and Singapore regions had the highest and lowest GMVI, respectively. In general, consumption of LCZ increased the relative abundance of certain beneficial bacteria such as Lactobacillus, Roseburia, Coprococcus and Eubacterium rectale, while it inhibited growth of certain harmful bacteria such as Blautia and Ralstonia pickettii. In addition, consumption of LCZ was responsible for the conversion of some participants from Prevotella copri/Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (PF) enterotype to Faecalibacterium prausnitzii/Bacteroides dorei (FB) enterotype and consistently increased the abundance of lactic acid bacteria in the gut. It also increased/enhanced phosphate metabolic modules, amino acid transport systems, and isoleucine biosynthesis, but conversely decreased lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis.

The results showed that the expression of Muc2 and Occlaudin were both significantly down-regulated (p < 0.05) by E. coli O157 infection, while GOS alleviated this phenomenon, which means that GOS can reduce the colonization of E. coli O157 by enhancing the gut barrier function. Through the determination of inflammatory cytokines, we found that GOS can relieve inflammation caused by pathogens. At the same time, GOS can promote the growth of probiotics such as Akkermansia, Ruminococcaceae and Bacteroides, thus modulating microorganism environments and improving short chain fatty acid (SCFA) levels in the intestine.

Twenty-five active patients with UC were assigned to the probiotic (n = 12) and placebo (n = 13) groups. The probiotic group received mesalazine (60 mg kg−1 day−1) and oral probiotics (containing Lactobacillus casei Zhang, Lactobacillus plantarum P-8 and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis V9) twice daily for 12 weeks, while the placebo group received the same amounts of mesalazine and placebo. The clinical outcomes were assessed. The gut mucosal microbiota was profiled by PacBio single-molecule, real-time (SMRT) sequencing of the full-length 16S rRNA of biopsy samples obtained by colonoscopy. A significantly greater magnitude of reduction was observed in the UC disease activity index (UCDAI) in the probiotic group compared with the placebo group (P = 0.043), accompanying by a higher remission rate (91.67% for probiotic-receivers versus 69.23% for placebo-receivers, P = 0.034). The probiotics could protect from diminishing of the microbiota diversity and richness.

A total of 120 forty-six-week-old breeding geese (Wulong) were randomly assigned to 1 of 6 treatment diets formulated to supply 10, 20, and 30 mg/kg Mn with 5 × 109 CFU/kg or 2.5 × 109 CFU/kg BS for a 10-wk trial. Results showed that dietary supplementation with 20 and 30 mg/kg Mn could decrease the daily feed intake (DFI) of geese. Moreover, 30 mg/kg Mn significantly increased the laying rate. Besides, although Mn addition had no obvious effect on egg quality, 5 × 109 CFU/kg BS was found to elevate the hatching egg hatching rate and eggshell thickness. For the serum hormones, 30 mg/kg Mn promoted estradiol secretion, while 5 × 109 CFU/kg BS increased the level of follicle-stimulating hormone. Furthermore, 20 and 30 mg/kg Mn and 5 × 109 CFU/kg BS significantly enhanced the total antioxidant capacity by increasing the activity of total superoxide dismutases or decreasing the content of malondialdehyde. Dietary supplementation with 5 × 109 CFU/kg BS also increased the intestinal villus height and upregulated the abundance of Fusobacteria, Fusobacteriaceae, Fusobacterium, and Faecalibacterium in cecal content. In addition, 20 and 30 mg/kg Mn elevated the levels of Bacteroidetes, Bacteroidaceae, Bacteroides, and Ruminococcaceae but decreased Streptococcaceae. Importantly, an interaction effect was observed between Mn and BS on the DFI, egg mass, average egg size, and the abundance of Bacteroides as well as Faecalibacterium. In conclusion, dietary inclusion of Mn and BS could improve the production performance, egg quality, antioxidant capacity, intestinal structure, as well as gut microbiota.

"Kassaian N., Feizi A., Rostami S., Aminorroaya A., Yaran M., Amini M.",The effects of 6 mo of supplementation with probiotics and synbiotics on gut microbiota in the adults with prediabetes: A double blind randomized clinical trial,2020,Nutrition,10.1016/j.nut.2020.110854,"Objectives: The evidence of 16S rRNA genes in the gut microbiota distinguished a higher Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio in individuals who were obese and had diabetes than in a healthy cohort. So, it seems that the modulation of intestinal microbial ecology by pro-/pre-/synbiotics may contribute to the progression and prevention of metabolic diseases. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of probiotics and synbiotic supplementation on the modification of the intestinal microbiome in adults with prediabetes. Methods: In a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial, 120 patients with prediabetes were randomly assigned to consume 6 g/d of either a placebo containing maltodextrin (control) or multispecies probiotic or inulin-based synbiotic for 6 mo. Fecal samples were obtained at baseline and after 6 mo of supplementation. Dietary intake was assessed throughout the study (at baseline and after 3 and 6 mo). Total energy, macronutrients, and dietary fiber were calculated using a dietary program Nutritionist 4. DNA was extracted from fecal samples and the numbers of Clostridium perfringens (the represent of phylum Firmicutes), Bacteroides fragilis (the representative of Bacteroidetes) and Escherichia coli (as universal bacteria) were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reactions (qPCR). The changes in the relative abundance of the two fecal bacteria before and after supplementation were analyzed and compared within and between groups. Results: There were no significant changes in dietary intake during the study. Six mo of supplementation with probiotics resulted in a statistically significant increase in the abundance of the B. fragilis-to-E.coli ratio (mean difference [MD] ± SE 0.47 ± 0.37, P = 0.04) and decrease of the relative proportion of Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes representatives (MD ± SE –118.8 ± 114.6, P = 0.02). Synbiotic had no significant effect on the changes in the bacteria. There were no significant differences between the three groups. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that manipulation of the human gut microbiome by using probiotics could provide a potential therapeutic approach in the prevention and management of obesity and metabolic disorders such as diabetes. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",10.0

The clinical significance of the microbiome of the first stool is not known. Infantile colic has earlier been associated with the composition of the intestinal microbiome. Methods: We set out to test whether the microbiome of the first stool is associated with subsequent infantile colic in a prospective, population-based cohort study of 212 consecutive newborn infants. We used next-generation sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. Results: The newborns who later developed infantile colic (n = 19) had a lower relative abundance of the genus Lactobacillus and the phylum Firmicutes in the first stool than those who remained healthy (n = 139). By using all microbiome data, random forest algorithm classified newborn with subsequent colic and those who remained healthy with area under the curve of 0.66 (SD 0.03) as compared to that of shuffled samples (P value <0.001). Conclusions: In this prospective, population-based study, the microbiome of the first-pass meconium was associated with subsequent infantile colic.

The importance of intestinal microbiota in production of secondary BA, for example, lithocholic acid (LCA) which impairs enterocyte proliferation and permeability, triggered us to determine the effects of oral probiotics on intestinal BA metabolism. Piglets were weaned at 28 d of age and allocated into control (CON, n 14) or probiotic (PRO, n 14) group fed 50 mg of Lactobacillus plantarum daily, and gut microbiota and BA profile were determined. To test the potential interaction of LCA with bacteria endotoxins in inducing damage of enterocytes, IPEC-J2 cells were treated with LCA, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and LCA + LPS and expressions of genes related to inflammation, antioxidant capacity and nutrient transport were determined. Compared with the CON group, the PRO group showed lower total LCA level in the ileum and higher relative abundance of the Lactobacillus genus in faeces. In contrast, the relative abundances of Bacteroides, Clostridium-sensu-stricto-1, Parabacteroides and Ruminococcus-1, important bacteria genera in BA biotransformation, were all lower in the PRO than in the CON group. Moreover, PRO piglets had lower postprandial glucagon-like peptide-1 level, while higher glucose level than CON piglets. Co-administration of LPS and LCA led to down-regulated expression of glucose and peptide transporter genes in IPEC-J2 cells. Altogether, oral L. plantarum altered BA profile probably by modulating relative abundances of gut microbial genera that play key roles in BA metabolism and might consequently impact glucose homoeostasis. The detrimental effect of LCA on nutrient transport in enterocytes might be aggravated under LPS challenge. © The Author(s), 2020.

A total of 360 1-day-old broilers were randomly divided into 3 groups, including a basal diet as negative control group (PC), basal diet plus antibiotics with 250 mg/kg calcium oxytetracycline and 200 mg/kg Nosiheptide as positive control (PC), and basal diet plus 500 mg/kg compound probiotics consisting of heat-inactivated Bacillus subtilis and Lactobacillus acidophilus BFI (BFI). Each group had 6 replicates of 20 chickens. On d 21, 42, and 63, one chick from each replicate was selected for blood collection and cecal sampling. Compared to the NC group, dietary supplementation with heat-inactivated compound probiotics increased the feed efficiency during d 1–63 (P < 0.05). The plasma cholesterol content at 42 d and creatinine content at 63 d were decreased by dietary supplementation with heat-inactivated compound probiotics (P < 0.05). The dominant phyla in broiler cecal microbiota were Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria, while the dominant genera were Bacteroides, Ruminococcaceae, and Phascolarctobacterium. The β-diversity index of cecal microbiota in BFI group was increased at d 42 (P < 0.01) and d 63 (P < 0.05). Dietary heat-inactivated compound probiotics increased the relative abundances of Barnesiellaceae (family), Barnesiella (genus), and Lactobacillus aviarius (species) at d 21, and reduced the relative abundances of genera Lachnoclostridium and Peptococcus at d 42, and unidentified Lachnospiraceae and Lachnoclostridium at d 63. The functional prediction of microbiota revealed that supplementation with heat-inactivated compound probiotics enriched the pathways related to methane metabolism, transcription machinery, purine metabolism and protein export. The Spearman's correlation analysis identified a significant correlation between cecal microbiota composition and overall feed efficiency and plasma metabolites. Collectively, dietary heat-inactivated compound probiotics with Bacillus subtilis and Lactobacillus acidophilus BFI enhanced feed efficiency, and decreased plasma cholesterol and creatinine contents, which might be associated with the modulation of community composition, diversity and functions of cecal microbiota in yellow-feathered broilers. These results indicated the potential of heat-inactivated probiotics used as alternatives to antibiotics for improvement of broiler health and productivity. © Copyright © 2020 Zhu, Gong, Huang, Li, Tong and Zhang.",3.0

In addition, the bacteria genera, metabolism pathways and its proteins involved in the biosynthesis of alpha-solanine in the cecum were also characterized. The results showed that B. coagulans R11 feeding could increase the concentration of alpha-solanine, even with lead exposure. Mevalonic acid and MEP/DOXP pathways were both participated in the biosynthesis of alpha-solanine; at the same time, the gut metabolites (S)-2-amino-6-oxohexanoate, N2-succinyl-L-ornithine and the bacteria proteins atoB, ispH were shown to be crucial role in the biosynthesis of alpha-solanine in the gut. The genera Faecalibacterium sp. An77 and Faecalibacterium sp. An58 2 were important in the biosynthesis of alpha-solanine, which provided the key proteins atoB and ispH. In addition, alpha-solanine could decrease the abundance of Prevotella sp. 109 and Prevotella marshii. In conclusion, alpha-solanine could be biosynthesized by cecal microorganisms with the stimulation of B. coagulans R11 in the intestine of laying hens, in addition, alpha-solanine was the main compound which also decreased the abundance of gut potential. © Copyright © 2020 Xing, Chen, Chen, Wu, Huang, Zhang, Mi and Liao.",3.0

Our aim was to investigate quantitative differences in fecal bacterial compositions of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients compared to those of healthy children, so as to identify individual bacterial species that are related to the etiology of ALL. We recruited 81 subjects, including 58 patients with ALL and 23 healthy controls. Fecal samples were collected and examined by 16S rRNA quantitative arrays and bioinformatics analysis. Both Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) and Non-metric Multidimensional scaling (NMDS) demonstrated that the microbial composition of ALL patients deviated from the tight cluster of healthy controls. Multiple bacterial species exhibited significant changes (e.g., Roseburia faecis, Edwardsiella tarda, and Fusobacterium naviforme) in the ALL samples. Some of the differentially abundant taxa were correlated with the level of interleukin-10. The ALL cases could be efficiently distinguished from healthy controls by the random forest model based on differential species (area under ROC curve = 0.843). Taken together, the composition of gut microbiota differed from healthy controls to pediatric ALL patients.

However, whether B. fragilis (ATCC 25285) has the beneficial effects on the treatment of lupus nephritis has still remained elusive. In the present study, oral treatment with B. fragilis (ATCC 25285) ameliorated the activity of MRL/lpr mice, including decreased levels of autoantibodies and symptoms of lupus nephritis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that treatment with B. fragilis (ATCC 25285) could promote CD1d expression in B cells by Est-1 pathway, while inhibit CD86 expression via SHP-2 signaling pathway to repair the immune response of B cells in MRL/lpr mice. In addition, our findings revealed a possible role of treatment with B. fragilis (ATCC 25285) in relieving intestinal inflammation in MRL/lpr mice.

C57BL/6J mice were fed with LFD, HFD/F, HFD/F supplemented with CQPC06, and HFD/F supplemented with LDBS for 8 weeks to test the properties of the probiotic. Biochemical and molecular biology methods were used to determine the levels of related indexes in mouse serum, liver tissue, epididymal fat, small intestine tissue, and feces. The results showed that CQPC06 exhibited satisfactory probiotic properties, significantly inhibited mouse weight gain, and decreased the liver index and serum lipid levels, including ALT, AKP, AST, TC, TG, LDL-C, LPS, and HDL-C levels. The HOMA-IR index calculated based on the blood glucose levels and serum insulin levels showed that the HOMA-IR index of NAFLD mice treated with CQPC06 significantly decreased. From the molecular biology level, CQPC06 significantly increased the mRNA and protein expression of PPAR-α, CYP7A1, CPT1, and LPL in NAFLD mouse livers, and decreased the expression of PPAR-γ and C/EBP-α. Furthermore, CQPC06 enhanced the expression of ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-1 in the small intestine of NAFLD mice, and decreased the expression of CD36. CQPC06 decreased the level of Firmicutes and increased the levels of Bacteroides and Akkermansia in the feces of NAFLD mice, and the ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroides was significantly decreased. CQPC06 is highly resistant in vitro and survived in the gastrointestinal tract and exerted its probiotic effect, altered the intestinal microecology of NAFLD mice, and played an important role in NAFLD prevention through the unique anatomical advantages of the gut-liver axis.

Lactobacilli are well known for their probiotic characteristics, although some species may become pathogenic and exert negative effects on human health. The transportome of an organism consists of the sum of the transport proteins encoded within its genome, and studies on the transportome help in the understanding of the various physiological processes taking place in the cell. In this communication we analyze the transport proteins and predict probable substrate specificities of ten Lactobacillus strains. Six of these strains (L. brevis, L. bulgaricus, L. crispatus, L. gasseri, L. reuteri, and L. ruminis) are currently believed to be only probiotic (OP). The remaining four strains (L. acidophilus, L. paracasei, L. planatarum, and L. rhamnosus) can play dual roles, being both probiotic and pathogenic (PAP). The characteristics of the transport systems found in these bacteria were compared with strains (E. coli, Salmonella, and Bacteroides) from our previous studies. Overall, the ten lactobacilli contain high numbers of amino acid transporters, but the PAP strains contain higher number of sugar, amino acid and peptide transporters as well as drug exporters than their OP counterparts. Moreover, some of the OP strains contain pore-forming toxins and drug exporters similar to those of the PAP strains, thus indicative of yet unrecognized pathogenic potential. The transportomes of the lactobacilli seem to be finely tuned according to the extracellular and probiotic lifestyles of these organisms. Taken together, the results of this study help to reveal the physiological and pathogenic potential of common prokaryotic residents in the human body. © 2020 by the authors.

However, if Bacteroidaceae are to be used as probiotics, the species selected for different hosts should reflect the natural distribution. In this study, we therefore evaluated host adaptation of bacterial species belonging to the family Bacteroidaceae. B. dorei, B. uniformis, B. xylanisolvens, B. ovatus, B. clarus, B. thetaiotaomicron and B. vulgatus represented human-adapted species while B. gallinaceum, B. caecigallinarum, B. mediterraneensis, B. caecicola, M. massiliensis, B. plebeius and B. coprocola were commonly detected in chicken but not human gut microbiota. There were 29 genes which were present in all human-adapted Bacteroides but absent from the genomes of all chicken isolates, and these included genes required for the pentose cycle and glutamate or histidine metabolism. These genes were expressed during an in vitro competitive assay, in which human-adapted Bacteroides species overgrew the chicken-adapted isolates. Not a single gene specific for the chicken-adapted species was found. Instead, chicken-adapted species exhibited signs of frequent horizontal gene transfer, of KUP, linA and sugE genes in particular. The differences in host adaptation should be considered when the new generation of probiotics for humans or chickens is designed. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",5.0

The SHIME® experiment was performed using the probiotic sausage for two weeks. The gut microbiota composition was monitored weekly in all colon vessels by plate counts and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). Samples of the colonic contents were evaluated microbiologically by plate counts and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) and chemically by the production of SCFA (acetate, propionate and butyrate) and ammonium ions (NH+4). It was observed that the consumption of the potentially probiotic sausage can result in a reduced count of Lactobacillus spp. (colon vessels 3, 4 and 5), Bacteroides spp. (colon vessel 5) and Enterobacteriaceae (colon vessels 4 and 5) and increased levels of ammonium ions. The butyric and propionic acids increased (P &lt; 0.05) while acetic acid decreased (P &lt; 0.05) in treatment period.

Insight into the complex interaction between gut microbiota and the human adaptive immune system will help guide future immunotherapeutic cancer treatments to allow a more robust clinical response and fewer adverse effects in patients requiring these drugs. This review highlights these interactions as well as the potential for the creation of ""oncomicrobiotics""that would selectively tailor one's GI bacteria to maximally respond to anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 treatments will fewer adverse effects. Main body: CTLA-4 is an antigen on the surface of T cells which, upon stimulation, leads to inhibition of activated T cells to terminate the immune response. However, many types of tumor cells can upregulate CTLA-4 in the tumor microenvironment, allowing these cells to evade targeting and destruction by the body's immune system by prematurely inhibiting T cells. Increased representation of Bacteroides fragilis, Burkholderia cepacia and the Faecalibacterium genus in the GI tract of patients receiving CTLA-4-based immunotherapy led to a stronger therapeutic effect while minimizing adverse side effects such as colitis. In addition, by introducing bacteria involved in vitamin B and polyamine transport to the GI tracts of patients treated with anti-CTLA-4 drugs led to increased resistance to colitis while maintaining therapeutic efficacy. PD-1 is another molecule upregulated in many tumor microenvironments which acts in a similar manner to CTLA-4 to tone down the anti-neoplastic actions of T cells. Antibodies to PD-1 have shown promise to help allow the body's natural immune response to appropriately target and destroy tumor cells. The presence of Bifidobacterium breve and longum, Akkermansia muciniphila and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii in the GI tracts of cancer patients has the potential to create a more robust immune response to anti-PD-1 drugs and prolonged survival. The development of ""oncomicrobiotics""has the potential to help tailor one's gut microbiota to allow patients to maximally respond to immunotherapy without sacrificing increases in toxicity. These oncomicrobiotics may possibly include antibiotics, probiotics, postbiotics and/or prebiotics. However, many challenges lie ahead in the creation of oncomicrobiotics. Conclusion: The creation of oncomicrobiotics may allow many patients receiving anti-CTLA-4 and PD-1 immunotherapy to experience prolonged survival and a better quality of life. © 2020 The Author(s).",11.0

We used microbial dilution plate methods, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and high-throughput sequencing approaches to analyze viable main microorganism counts, short chain fatty acid (SCFA) concentrations, and intestinal microbiota composition in feces, respectively. Our data showed that L. casei ZX633 supplementation increased the numbers of Escherichia coli, yeasts, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and aerobic-bacteria, raised propionic acid levels but reduced four other SCFAs, which are close to the healthy group. Alpha diversity results indicated that microbial diversity and richness decreased in treatment group. Bacterial community analyses revealed that microbial structures of the treatment group tended toward the healthy group; i.e., Escherichia-Shigella and Clostridioides abundance increased, and there was a reduction in the abundance of Streptococcus, Bacteroides, Enterococcus and Veillonella.

In this study, we sequenced the bacterial 16S rRNA gene to evaluate changes in fecal microbiota between 48 children with ASD and 48 healthy children in China. At the phylum level, the number of Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia decreased in children with ASD, while the Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes was significantly higher in autistic children due to enrichment of Bacteroidetes. At the genus level, the amount of Bacteroides, Prevotella, Lachnospiracea_incertae_sedis, and Megamonas increased, while Clostridium XlVa, Eisenbergiella, Clostridium IV, Flavonifractor, Escherichia/Shigella, Haemophilus, Akkermansia, and Dialister decreased in children with ASD relative to the controls. Significant increase was observed in the number of species synthesizing branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), like Bacteroides vulgatus and Prevotella copri, while the numbers of Bacteroides fragilis and Akkermansia muciniphila decreased in children with ASD compared to the controls. Most importantly, the highest levels of pathogenic bacteria were different for each child with ASD in this cohort. We found that only one functional module, cellular antigens, was enriched in children with ASD, and other pathways like lysine degradation and tryptophan metabolism were significantly decreased in children with ASD. These findings provide further evidence of altered gut microbiota in Chinese ASD children and may contribute to the treatment of patients with ASD. Lay Summary: This study characterized the gut bacteria composition of 48 children with ASD and 48 neurotypical children in China. The metabolic disruptions caused by altered gut microbiota may contribute significantly to the neurological pathophysiology of ASD, including significant increases in the number of species synthesizing BCAAs, and decreases in the number of probiotic species. These findings suggest that a gut microbiome-associated therapeutic intervention may provide a novel strategy for treating GI symptoms frequently seen in individuals with ASD.

After that, five GH29A α-L-fucosidases were cloned, and four of them were successfully heterogeneous expressed and screened for transglycosylation activity, and a GH29A α-L-fucosidase (BF3242) that synthesized a mix of Fuc-α-1,3/1,6-GlcNAc disaccharides using pNPαFuc as donor and GlcNAc as acceptor was characterized. The effects of initial substrate concentration, pH, temperature, and reaction time on its transglycosylation activity were studied in detail. Under the optimum conditions of 0.05 U/mL enzyme, 20 mM pNPαFuc, and 500 mM GlcNAc in sodium buffer (pH 7.5) at 37 °C for 45 min, BF3242 efficiently synthesized Fuc-α-1,3/1,6-GlcNAc at a maximum yield of 79.0% with the ratio of 0.48 for 1,3/1,6. The molecular dynamics simulation analysis revealed that Loop-4 (His220-Ser245) in the putative 3D model of BF3242 displayed significant changes throughout the thermal simulations, might being responsible for the changes in the ratio of two regioisomeric products at different temperatures. This work provided not only a potential synthetic tool for enzymatic synthesis of fucosyl-N-acetylglucosamine disaccharides but also a possibility for the formation of regioisomeric products in glycosidase-catalyzed transglycosylation. Key points: • Sequence analysis of α-L-fucosidases of Bacteroides fragilis NCTC9343 • Obtainment of an α-L-fucosidase with high transglycosylation activity • Explanation why temperature affected the ratio of two regioisomeric products. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",4.0

Despite widespread antibiotic use, our understanding of the species and metabolic functions contributing to gut microbiome recovery is limited. Using data from 4 discovery cohorts in 3 continents comprising >500 microbiome profiles from 117 individuals, we identified 21 bacterial species exhibiting robust association with ecological recovery post antibiotic therapy. Functional and growth-rate analysis showed that recovery is supported by enrichment in specific carbohydrate-degradation and energy-production pathways. Association rule mining on 782 microbiome profiles from the MEDUSA database enabled reconstruction of the gut microbial ‘food web’, identifying many recovery-associated bacteria as keystone species, with the ability to use host- and diet-derived energy sources, and support repopulation of other gut species. Experiments in a mouse model recapitulated the ability of recovery-associated bacteria (Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Bifidobacterium adolescentis) to promote recovery with synergistic effects, providing a boost of two orders of magnitude to microbial abundance in early time points and faster maturation of microbial diversity. The identification of specific species and metabolic functions promoting recovery opens up opportunities for rationally determining pre- and probiotic formulations offering protection from long-term consequences of frequent antibiotic usage. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",32.0

Still, our understanding of the relationship between the intestinal microbiota and body-mass in grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) remains limited. Herein, we explored this association in the anterior, middle, and posterior intestine of cohabitating grass carp by using next-generation sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. The results showed that alpha diversity indices of the low-weight-gain (LWG) groups were higher than that of the high-weight-gain (HWG) groups. HWG groups possessed the decreased ratio of Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes compared with that in the LWG groups. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) revealed that there were significant differences between the HWG and LWG groups. Furthermore, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) coupled with effect size (LEfSe) showed that the order Clostridiales were significantly abundant in the HWG groups. Phylogenetic molecular ecology networks (pMENs) showed a lower average path distance (GD), higher average clustering coefficient (avgCC), and higher average degree (avgK) in the HWG group. Our results suggested that there appeared to be a tight correlation between the intestinal microbiota and body-mass in grass carp.

Methods and Results: The gut microbiota of children with obesity and normal-weight children were investigated by high-throughput sequencing, and based on the different composition in gut microbiota, the strains with potential anti-obesity properties were screened in vitro and in vivo. Compared with normal-weight children, the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio in children with obesity decreased. Moreover the relative abundances of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium in children with obesity were decreased, while the relative abundance of Akkermansia increased. After a series of screening in vitro and in vivo, nine strains were found inhibiting the body weight gain of HFD-fed mice, of which two strains showed significant effects (P < 0·05). Conclusions: There were significant changes in gut microbiota of children with obesity from Harbin, China. The obtained strains showed obvious anti-obesity effects, and the screening methods used in this study were effective.

Methods: C57BL/6J mice were subjected to a standard or HFFD with or without supplementation of L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 for 10 weeks. Obesity related metabolic indices including glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, serum lipid, liver function, hormones and inflammatory cytokines were assessed by standard protocols. For the monitoring of inflammatory response and lipid metabolism, transcriptional levels were profiled in liver and/or adipose tissues. Furthermore, gut microbiota composition analyses in the fecal samples were performed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and gut microbial metabolites, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), were also tested for the assessment of the relationship between gut microbiota variation and inflammatory response. Results: Administration with L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 significantly mitigated body weight gain and insulin resistance, and inflammatory response (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 levels in serum and corresponding mRNA levels in adipose tissues) was significantly inhibited in these two strains-treated mice. Moreover, L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 could partially normalized mRNA expression levels involved in lipid metabolism including Pparγ, Srebp-1c, CD36, Fabp2 and FAS. In addition, these two strains manipulated gut microbiota by decreasing the abundance of Bacteroides and Desulfovibrio and increasing that of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, which in turn raised the levels of feces SCFAs and lowered the levels of circulating LPS. Conclusion: These results indicated that L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 supplementation possessed the anti-obesity effect on the HFFD fed mice by alleviating inflammatory response and regulating gut microbiota, which further suggested that these two probiotics can be considered as an alternative dietary supplement in combination with the preventive and therapeutic strategies against obesity and related complications.

To limit the development of digestive bacterial infection, food supplements containing probiotic bacteria can be proposed. Commensal non-toxigenic Bacteroides fragilis has recently been suggested as a next-generation probiotic candidate. By using an original triple co-culture model including Caco-2 cells (representing human enterocytes), HT29-MTX (representing mucus-secreting goblet cells), and M cells differentiated from Caco-2 by addition of Raji B lymphocytes, bacterial translocation was evaluated. The data showed that S. Heidelberg could translocate in the triple co-culture model with high efficiency, whereas for B. fragilis a weak translocation was obtained. When cells were exposed to both bacteria, S. Heidelberg translocation was inhibited. The cell-free supernatant of B. fragilis also inhibited S. Heidelberg translocation without impacting epithelial barrier integrity. This supernatant did not affect the growth of S. Heidelberg. The non-toxigenic B. fragilis confers health benefits to the host by reducting bacterial translocation.

However, generalizable strategies that accomplish this with high specificity have been slow to emerge. Here we develop programmed inhibitor cells (PICs) that direct the potent antibacterial activity of the type VI secretion system (T6SS) against specified target cells. The PICs express surface-displayed nanobodies that mediate antigen-specific cell–cell adhesion to effectively overcome the barrier to T6SS activity in fluid conditions. We demonstrate the capacity of PICs to efficiently deplete low-abundance target bacteria without significant collateral damage to complex microbial communities. The only known requirements for PIC targeting are a Gram-negative cell envelope and a unique cell surface antigen; therefore, this approach should be generalizable to a wide array of bacteria and find application in medical, research, and environmental settings. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",20.0
"Yu Y., Lu J., Oliphant K., Gupta N., Claud K., Lu L.",Maternal administration of probiotics promotes gut development in mouse offsprings,2020,PLoS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0237182,"Necrotizing enterocolitis is the most common gastrointestinal disorder in premature neonates. This disease is characterized by massive epithelial necrosis, gut barrier dysfunction and improper mucosal defense development. Studies have shown that probiotic administration can decrease NEC incidence and mortality. The proposed mechanisms of probiotics for the prevention of NEC are: promotion of intestinal development; improved barrier function through decreased apoptosis and improved mucin production; decreased expression of proinflammatory cytokines IL6, IL8, and TNFα, and modulation of microbiota dysbiosis in preterm infants. However, reported sepsis in the immunocompromised preterm host has deterred routine prophylactic administration of probiotics in the neonatal intensive care unit. We hypothesize that maternal administration of probiotics to pregnant mouse dams can recapitulate the beneficial effects observed in neonates fed with probiotics directly. We exposed pregnant mice to the probiotics and monitored the changes in the developing intestines of the offspring. Pregnant mice were fed daily with the probiotics Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium infantis (LB) from embryonic day15 to 2-week-old postnatally. Intraperitoneal administration of IL-1β in the pups was used to model proinflammatory insults. Sera were collected at 2 weeks of age and evaluated for inflammatory cytokines by enzyme-linked-immunosorbent-assay and gut permeability by Fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran tracer assay. Ileal tissues were collected for the evaluation of apoptosis and proliferation of the intestinal epithelium; as well as mucin and tight junction integrity at mucosal surface by immunofluorescent staining. We find that maternal LB exposure facilitated intestinal epithelial cell differentiation, prevented loss of mucin and preserved the intestinal integrity and barrier function and decreased serum levels of IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6 in the preweaned offsprings. in LB exposed pups. We demonstrate that maternal probiotic supplementation promotes gut maturation in developing offspring. This is potentially a safe alternative therapy to induce intestinal maturation and prevent prematurity-associated neonatal disorders. Copyright: © 2020 Yu et al.

Currently the disease is managed with antimicrobials and vaccination; however, emergence of multi-drug resistant Mycoplasma and the limited effect of vaccines necessitate development of novel approaches. A library of 4,182 small molecules (SMs) was screened for identification of narrow spectrum anti-MG compounds using high throughput screening. A total of 584 SMs were identified. Ten SMs possessed low MICs (0.78–100 μM) with efficacy against multiple MG strains and MG biofilm. These 10 SMs did not affect commensal/probiotic bacteria and other avian and foodborne pathogens. They displayed no or little toxicity on the avian macrophage HD-11 cells, human epithelial Caco-2 cells, and chicken red blood cells (RBCs); but, they were effective in reducing MG in chicken RBCs. Six SMs (SM1, SM3−5, and SM9−10) were tested in three-week-old chickens infected with MG (nasal spray; 109 CFU/bird). SM4 and SM9 reduced airsacculitis by 77.2 % and 82.9 %, MG load in the trachea by 0.9 log (p &lt; 0.05) and 2.7 log (p &lt; 0.0001), and tracheal mucosal thickness by 23 % and 61 %, respectively with no impact on the richness and evenness of the cecal (P = 0.6; H = 1.0) and tracheal (P = 0.8; H = 0.8) microbiota compared to the MG-infected controls.

Antimicrobial peptides and proteins secreted in the gastrointestinal tract are powerful tools against bacteria. Lactoferrin (LF) inhibits the growth of several bacterial species, such as Enterobacteriaceae, but may stimulate probiotic bacteria. Activity of LF against gut symbiotic species of the Bacteroides genus could give us insights on how these species colonize the gut. We investigated the effects of the antimicrobial protein lactoferrin and its derived peptide, lactoferricin B on two species of strict anaerobes, opportunistic pathogens that cause diseases in both adults and children, commonly found in the microbiota of the human gastrointestinal tract, Bacteroides fragilis and B. thetaiotaomicron., In vitro biofilm formation and binding to laminin were strongly inhibited by a low concentration of lactoferrin (12.5 μg/ml). Conversely, the growth of the strains in a micro-dilution assay in minimal media with different iron sources was not affected by physiological concentrations (2 mg/ml) of apo-lactoferrin or holo-lactoferrin. The combination of lactoferrin with antibiotics in synergism assays was also negative. The lactoferricin B fragment was also unable to inhibit growth in a similar test with concentrations of up to 32 μg/ml. Resistance to lactoferrin could confer an advantage to these species, even when high amount of this protein is present in the gastrointestinal tract. However, colonization is hampered by the binding and biofilm inhibitiory effect of lactoferrin, which may explain the low prevalence of Bacteroides in healthy babies. Resistance to this antimicrobial protein may help understand the success of these opportunistic pathogens during infection in the peritoneum. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",6.0

Compound strains of Lactobacillus reuteri and Lactobacillus salivarius were supplemented to piglets during pre- and post-weaning to determine their effects in improving the growth performance and ameliorating the diarrhea rate and stress caused by antioxidation in piglets. A larger number of L. reuteri and L. salivarius colonized the distal segment of the ileum and the total numbers of Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacteria were higher in the ileal mucous membrane and cecal lumen with probiotics supplementation. The numbers of antioxidants and immune molecules increased, levels of cortisol and endotoxin reduced, and growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor 1 improved in the plasma following compound bacteria (CL) supplementation. Spearman’s and KEGG analysis of the bacterial operational taxonomic unit and antioxidative and immune indices and metabolic genes indicated that the body growth modulation by CL supplementation could be attributed to optimization of the intestinal bacterial composition; functional strains of L. delbrueckii, L. salivarius, L. formicilis, L. reuteri, and L. mucosae were positively correlated with body antioxidation and immunity derived by CL supplementation. Strains of L. agilis and L. pontis were diverse and negatively correlated with body antioxidation and immunity. Collectively, these results suggest that supplementation with CL could reduce stress and improve the growth performance of piglets during weaning by optimizing the intestinal bacterial composition. Key points: • The colonization of L. reuteri and L. salivarius in ileal mucous membrane optimize bacterial composition of GIT, mainly some functional strains of Lactobacillus, L. delbrueckii, L. salivarius, L. formicilis, L. reuteri, and L. mucosae. • The optimized bacterial composition of piglets in both ileal mucous membrane and cecal content improves body growth hormone level, immunity, and antioxidation, which is helpful to defend the stress. These benefits induce to increased growth performance of animal model piglets during weaning. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",8.0

Nevertheless, improvement of durability and prediction of responses remain unmet medical needs. While it has been recognized that antibiotics (ATBs) decrease the clinical activity of ICB across various malignancies, little is known about the direct impact of distinct intestinal nonpathogenic bacteria (commensals) on therapeutic outcomes of ICB in RCC. Objective: To evaluate the predictive value of stool bacteria composition for ICB efficacy in a cohort of advanced RCC patients. Design, setting, and participants: We prospectively collected fecal samples from 69 advanced RCC patients treated with nivolumab and enrolled in the GETUG-AFU 26 NIVOREN microbiota translational substudy phase 2 trial (NCT03013335) at Gustave Roussy. We recorded patient characteristics including ATB use, prior systemic therapies, and response criteria. We analyzed 2994 samples of feces from healthy volunteers (HVs). In parallel, preclinical studies performed in RCC-bearing mice that received fecal transplant (FMT) from RCC patients resistant to ICB (NR-FMT) allowed us to draw a cause-effect relationship between gut bacteria composition and clinical outcomes for ICB. The influence of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) taken before starting nivolumab on the microbiota composition has also been assessed. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: Metagenomic data (MG) from whole genome sequencing (WGS) were analyzed by multivariate and pairwise comparisons/fold ratio to identify bacterial fingerprints related to ATB or prior TKI exposure and patients’ therapeutic response (overall response and progression-free survival), and compared with the data from cancer-free donors. Results and limitations: Recent ATB use (n = 11; 16%) reduced objective response rates (from 28% to 9%, p < 0.03) and markedly affected the composition of the microbiota, facilitating the dominance of distinct species such as Clostridium hathewayi, which were also preferentially over-represented in stools from RCC patients compared with HVs. Importantly, TKIs taken prior to nivolumab had implications in shifting the microbiota composition. To establish a cause-effect relationship between gut bacteria composition and ICB efficacy, NR-FMT mice were successfully compensated with either FMT from responding RCC patients or beneficial commensals identified by WGS-MG (Akkermansia muciniphila and Bacteroides salyersiae). Conclusions: The composition of the microbiota is influenced by TKIs and ATBs, and impacts the success of immunotherapy. Future studies will help sharpen the role of these specific bacteria and their potential as new biomarkers. Patient summary: We used quantitative shotgun DNA sequencing of fecal microbes as well as preclinical models of fecal or bacterial transfer to study the association between stool composition and (pre)clinical outcome to immune checkpoint blockade. Novel insights into the pathophysiological relevance of intestinal dysbiosis in the prognosis of kidney cancer may lead to innovative therapeutic solutions, such as supplementation with probiotics to prevent primary resistance to therapy. Antibiotics prior to immune checkpoint inhibitors have a deleterious clinical impact, reduce the microbiome diversity, and increase Clostridium hathewayi bacteria associated with resistance. Higher baseline microbiome diversity and Akkermansia muciniphila are associated with longer progression-free survival. In murine fecal microbiome transplantation experiments, A. muciniphila can restore the anticancer activity of the combination of anti–PD-1 and CTLA-4. © 2020",57.0

The gut microbiota is essential to maintain physiological homeostasis and immune regulation of host. Therefore, the objectives were to determine the effects of probiotics on the clinical symptoms, immune responses, and gut microbiota in AD patients. Methods: 109 patients were randomly divided into 4 groups, including placebo group, oligosaccharides group, Bifidobacterium bifidum CCFM16 group, and Lactobacillus plantarum CCFM8610 group. At the end of the experiment, serological indicators, SCORAD, and DLQI indices were assessed. V3–V4 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene was sequenced to evaluate changes in the gut microbiota. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size was used to uncover microbial biomarkers and PICRUSt (Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States) was used to predict gene family abundances based on 16S information. Results: The results demonstrated that CCFM8610 significantly decreased the SCORAD index, and increased the serum IL-10 levels. Supplement with CCFM8610 and CCFM16 significantly influenced the alpha diversity, increased the proportion of Bacteroidetes, and reduced the F/B ratio. CCFM8610 treatment downregulated the functional genes of gut microbiota involving Staphylococcus aureus infection and upregulated the steroid hormone biosynthesis. Conclusion: The results indicated a positive correlation between decreased SCORAD index and CCFM8610 treatment, and that CCFM8610 regulated the immune responses in AD patients.

Black field cricket nymphs, grass grub larvae, and wax moth larvae were subjected to an in vitro digestion to simulate the oral, gastric, and small intestinal stages of digestion. The digested material was then dialyzed to remove small molecules such as amino acids and free sugars to simulate removal of nutrients through upper gastrointestinal tract digestion. The retentate, representing the digestion resistant constituents, was then fermented in fecal batch cultures for 4, 7, and 15 h to represent rapid and longer fermentation times. Batch cultures without any added substrates were also set up to act as controls. Additionally, phosphate-buffered saline was used as a no-protein control and milk powder as “standard” protein control. At the end of the incubation period, the bacterial pellets were collected for microbiome analysis by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Analysis of fecal cultures showed striking differences in community composition. Each substrate led to significant differences across a wide range of taxa compared to each other and PBS controls. Among the differences observed, digested grass grub larvae increased proportions of Faecalibacterium and the Prevotella 2 group. Black field crickets increased the prevalence of the Escherichia–Shigella group, Dialister genus, and a group of unclassified Lachnospiraceae. Wax moth larvae promoted the expansion of the same group of unclassified Lachnospiraceae and the Escherichia/Shigella group. The increased Faecalibacterium observed in the cultures with grass grub larvae represents a noteworthy finding as this bacterium is widely thought to be beneficial in nature, with demonstrated anti-inflammatory properties and associations with gut health. We conclude that insects can differentially modulate the microbiome composition in batch cultures inoculated with adult fecal material after simulated in vitro digestion. Although the physiological impact in vivo remains to be determined, this study provides sound scientific evidence that investigating the potential for consuming insects for gut health is warranted. © Copyright © 2020 Young, Arojju, McNeill, Rettedal, Gathercole, Bell and Payne.",6.0

Samples of the colonic contents were evaluated microbiologically by real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) and next-generation sequencing and chemically by the production of SCFA (acetate, propionate and butyrate) and ammonium ions (NH 4 ). Statistical analyses were carried out for all the variables using the two-way ANOVA followed by the Tukey multiple comparisons test (P < 0-05) for metabolite production, qRT-PCR and the bioinformatics analysis for microbiota diversity. Dietary supplement and ice cream were able to deliver the probiotic L. acidophilus and B. animalis to the simulated colon and modulate the microbiota, increasing beneficial micro-organisms such as Bifidobacterium spp., Bacteroides spp. and Faecalibacterium spp. for dietary supplement administration, and Lactobacillus spp. for ice cream supplementation. However, the ice cream matrix was probably more favourable for the maintenance of the metabolic activity of the probiotics in the SHIME® model, due to the larger amounts of acetate, propionate, butyrate and ammonium ions obtained after 14 d of supplementation.

However, few studies have focused on the mechanisms of obesity-inducing probiotics. In a previous study, we demonstrated that specific bacterial strains isolated from kefir, Lactobacillus kefirnofaciens M1 and Lactobacillus mali APS1, possess obesity and anti-obesity effects, respectively, in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice. Thus, in the present study, we systematically investigated whether APS1 and M1 affect energy homeostasis and lipid metabolism in HFD-induced obese mice and how this might be achieved. We observed that the M1/APS1 intervention influenced fat accumulation by regulating adipogenesis and inflammation-related marker expression both in vitro and in a HFD induced C57BL/6J mice model. We also observed putative links between key taxa and possible metabolic processes of the gut microbiota. Notably, families Christensenellaceae and S24_7 were negatively correlated with body weight gain through increase in the essential esterized carnitine for energy expenditure. These results suggest the importance of specific probiotic interventions affecting leanness and obesity of subjects under a HFD, which are operated by modulating the tripartite relationship among the host, microbiota, and metabolites. © Copyright © 2020 Lin, Chen, Li and Chen.",4.0

The activity of the microbiota is integral in maintaining intestinal barrier function, disruption to which is proposed as a risk factor for the low-grade inflammation associated with insulin resistance. Can we target the microbiota through diet, and more specifically with prebiotics to improve barrier function and ultimately glycaemic control? This narrative review will discuss the evidence for barrier dysfunction in human type 2 diabetes and outline the recent evidence from clinical trials investigating the efficacy of prebiotics in glucose management.

"Dou X., Gao N., Yan D., Shan A.",Sodium butyrate alleviates mouse colitis by regulating gut microbiota dysbiosis,2020,Animals,10.3390/ani10071154,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) develops as a result of complicated interactions between genetic susceptibility, excessive innate immunity, and environmental factors, which are mainly related to the gut microbiota. The present study aimed to elucidate the protective effects and underlying mechanisms of a short-chain fatty acid salt, sodium butyrate, on colonic inflammation induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in mice. Pretreatment with sodium butyrate attenuated colitis, as demonstrated by the decreased disease activity index (DAI), colon length shortening, spleen tumidness, and histopathology scores, while maintaining intestinal barrier integrity, as observed by H&E staining and electron microscopy. 16S rRNA sequence analysis revealed that sodium butyrate caused a remarkable alteration of the gut microbiota. Bacteroides, Lachnospiraceae, the Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 group, and Ruminiclostridium 6 presented dramatic differences after sodium butyrate supplementation. This work verifies that sodium butyrate can improve mouse colitis via microbe–host interactions by regulating the microbial community. Taken together, the findings demonstrate that sodium butyrate shows great potential as a probiotic agent for ameliorating colitis. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",18.0

We now aim to evaluate the effects of DR7 on gut functions, gut microbiota compositional changes, and determine the correlations between microbiota changes and the pathways of brain neurotransmitters. The administration of DR7 prevented an increase of defecation frequency over 12 weeks as compared to the placebo (p = 0.044), modulating the increase of stress-induced bowel movement. Over 12 weeks, alpha diversity of gut microbiota was higher in DR7 than the placebo group across class (p = 0.005) and order (p = 0.018) levels, while beta diversity differed between groups at class and order levels (p < 0.001). Differences in specific bacterial groups were identified, showing consistency at different taxonomic levels that survived multiplicity correction, along the phyla of Bacteroides and Firmicutes and along the classes of Deltaproteobacteria and Actinobacteria. Bacteroidetes, Bacteroidia, and Bacteroidales which were reduced in abundance in the placebo group showed opposing correlation with gene expression of dopamine beta hydrolase (DBH, dopamine pathway; p < 0.001), while Bacteroidia and Bacteroidales showed correlation with tryptophan hydroxylase-II (TPH2, serotonin pathway; p = 0.001). A correlation was observed between DBH and Firmicutes (p = 0.002), Clostridia (p < 0.001), Clostridiales (p = 0.001), Blautia (p < 0.001), and Romboutsia (p < 0.001), which were increased in abundance in the placebo group. Blautia was also associated with TDO (p = 0.001), whereas Romboutsia had an opposing correlation with TPH2 (p < 0.001). Deltaproteobacteria and Desulfovibrionales which were decreased in abundance in the placebo group showed opposing correlation with DBH (p = 0.001), whereas Bilophila was associated with TPH2 (p = 0.001). Our present data showed that physiological changes induced by L. plantarum DR7 could be associated with changes in specific taxa of the gut microbiota along the serotonin and dopamine pathways. © 2020 by the authors.

In this study, Lactococcus lactis KA-FF 1-4 demonstrated to have the potential to inhibit the growth of Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) by producing anti-microbial substance. In co-culture, L. lactis KA-FF 1-4 (108 CFU/mL) inhibited the growth of VRE from 103–104 CFU/mL to zero after 6 h of exposure. However, in a gut model contained human gut microbiota, this anti-VRE activity of L. lactis KA-FF 1-4 was reduced to only 3.59–6.12%. The unexpected difference in efficacy between the experimental models could be explained by the fact that the growth of L. lactis KA-FF 1-4 was stable in the gut model. Leaving aside these limitations, we observed that adding L. lactis KA-FF 1-4 into the human gut model containing VRE was able to enhance microbial richness and diversity. Specifically, a higher abundance of beneficial microbes from the group of Bifidobacterium spp. and Bacteroides fragilis. L. lactis KA-FF 1-4 also enhanced the abundance of Parabacteroides, Lactococcus, and Fusobacterium and promoted the production of lactic acid in the gut model. However, these effects were not observed in the gut model without L. lactis KA-FF 1-4. Even though this study could not demonstrate a significant anti-VRE effect of the L. lactis KA-FF 1-4 in a gut model, our results still offer evidence that L. lactis KA-FF 1-4 could positively modulate the gut microbiota by promoting the growth of beneficial microbes and their metabolite. L. lactis KA-FF 1-4 has probiotic properties to fight against VRE infection, therefore further investigation in animal model is needed. © 2020, King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology.",3.0

Whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) is an effective method for the treatment of BM. However, it cannot be ignored that WBRT might induce a series of neuropsychiatric side effects, including cognitive dysfunction (CD). Accumulating evidence shows that the gut microbiota and the gut-microbiota–brain axis may play a vital role in the pathogenesis of CD. Objective and methods: We adopted WBRT to mimic CD after a hierarchical cluster analysis of the Morris water maze test (MWMT) results. In addition, we observed the effects of antibiotics and prebiotics on WBRT-induced CD. Variations were revealed via the 16S rRNA sequencing analysis at different levels. Results: The 16S rRNA sequencing analysis revealed an altered composition of gut microbiota between CD and non-CD phenotypes. Furthermore, we observed a decrease in the levels of Phylum-Bacteroidete, Class-Bacteroidia, and Order-Bacteroidales in the CD group and an increase in the Genus-Allobaculum level after WBRT. Pretreatment with antibiotics caused a significant decrease in the level of Phylum-TM7 01, whereas an increase in the levels of Class-Gammaproteobacteria, Order-Enterobacteriales, and Species-Escherichia coli. After pretreatment with probiotics, the levels of Phylum-Cyanobacteria, Class-4C0d-2, and Order-YS2 were decreased, while the levels of Family-Bacteroidaceae, Genus-Bacteroides, and Species-Parabacteroides distasonis were increased. Conclusions: WBRT-induced CD might be highly related to abnormal composition of gut microbiota. Strategies improving the composition of the gut microbiota may provide beneficial effects on CD in individuals exposed to WBRT. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",3.0

To investigate the existence of susceptible indigenous bacteria (SIB) to egg yolks (EY), mice were fed a diet containing either 20% (w/w) milk casein and 17% beef tallow (CT) or 12% milk casein and 27% EY for 14 days, and then, the cecal microbiome was analyzed by 16S rRNA (V4) amplicon sequencing. To isolate the typical species in each diet group, culture-dependent viable bacterial counts were determined on Blood Liver (BL) and Gifu Anaerobic Medium (GAM) agar plates. The amplicon sequencing analysis revealed typical CT-SIB, such as Lachnospiraceae-like bacteria, and EY-SIB, such as Allobaculum-, Lactobacillus murinus-, and Bacteroides vulgatus-like bacteria. Two of the detected SIB species, L. murinus- and B. vulgatus-like bacteria, were successfully isolated from the BL and GAM agar plates and defined using a 16S rDNA BLAST search. Practical applications: The SIB defined in the CT and EY groups might have some effects on the nutritional and functional chemical compounds in the milk casein, beef tallow, and/or EY.

"Zhou Y., Wei Y., Yan B., Zhao S., Zhou X.",Regulation of tartary buckwheat-resistant starch on intestinal microflora in mice fed with high-fat diet,2020,Food Science and Nutrition,10.1002/fsn3.1601,"Resistant starch (RS) is closely related to the composition of intestinal flora. Based on many studies on the physiological functions of probiotics and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), it is possible that RS can improve the intestinal health of the host. Therefore, we speculated that tartary buckwheat-resistant starch (TBRS) can also regulate the intestinal flora disorder caused by high-fat diet. We randomly divided 36 SPF C57BL/6J mice into low-fat diet, high-fat diet (HF-CS), high-fat diet supplemented with TBRS (HF-BRS), and high-fat diet supplemented with corn-resistant starch (HF-CRS). We analyzed the diversity and richness of gut microbiota based on PCR and Illumina high-throughput sequencing technology. In community abundance, the HF-BRS group was significantly higher than the other three groups (p <.05). TBRS improved the gut microbiota dysbiosis, including decreasing the Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratios (F/B) and contributing to the growth of Bacteroides and Blautia as well significantly inhibiting the growth of Bifidobacterium, Faecalibaculum, and Erysipelatoclostridium. We also analyzed the production of SCFAs by GC-MS, and the concentration of total SCFAs increased in the HF-CS group. However, TBRS significantly increased the production of SCFAs, especially the propionate concentration compared with the HF-CRS group (p <.05). These results elucidated that TBRS has the potential to improve intestinal health by altering the structure of gut microbiota and increasing the production of SCFAs. Our findings have important implications for TBRS as functional food ingredient to manipulate intestinal microflora. © 2020 The Authors.

Addition of probiotics as adjuvants for H. pylori antibiotic treatment can increase eradication rate and decrease treatment side effects. Although many studies show the benefits of S. boulardii CNCM I-745 in the treatment of H. pylori infection, the mechanism by which those benefits are achieved is unknown. Here, we report clinical characteristics and fecal microbiota changes comparing conventional anti-H. pylori therapy versus conventional therapy supplemented with S. boulardii CNCM I-745. A total of 74 patients were included in the current study; patients positive for H. pylori (n = 63) were randomly assigned to 2 groups: 34 patients received conventional therapy and 29 antibiotic therapy plus 750 mg of S. boulardii CNCM I-745 daily, for 2 weeks. Eleven patients negative for H. pylori infection were also studied. Patients provided 3 fecal samples: before initiating the antibiotic treatment, upon its completion, and 1 month after treatment. Patients were contacted every 72 h to inquire about side effects and compliance. DNA was extracted, and 16S rRNA was amplified and sequenced on Illumina MiSeq. Bioinformatic analysis was performed using QIIME2. Patients who received the probiotic had a significantly lower frequency of associated gastrointestinal symptoms (P = 0.028); higher number of bacterial diversity evenness (P = 0.0156); higher abundance of Enterobacteria; and lower abundance of Bacteroides and Clostridia upon treatment completion. Addition of S. boulardii CNCM I-745 induced a lower frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms that could be related to changes in gut microbiota. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",15.0

Recently, probiotics have been proposed as a remedy for antibiotic-induced dysbiosis, but the efficacy of such treatments remains uncertain. Thus, the effect of specific antibiotic-probiotic combinations on the gut microbiome and host health warrants further research. We tested the effect vancomycin, amoxicillin, and ciprofloxacin on mice. Antibiotic administration was followed by one of the following recovery treatments: Bifidobacterium bifidum JCM 1254 as a probiotic (PR); fecal transplant (FT); or natural recovery (NR). Each antibiotic administration and recovery treatment was repeated three times over 9 weeks. We used the Shannon Index and Chao1 Index to determine gut microbiome diversity and assessed recovery by quantifying the magnitude of microbial shift using the Bray-Curtis Index of Dissimilarity. We determined the community composition by sequencing the V3–V4 regions of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. To assess host health, we measured body weight and cecum weight, as well as mRNA expression of inflammation-related genes by reverse-transcription quantitative PCR. Our results show that community response varied by the type of antibiotic used, with vancomycin having the most significant effects. As a result, the effect of probiotics and fecal transplants also varied by antibiotic type. For vancomycin, the first antibiotic disturbance substantially increased the relative abundance of inflammatory species in the phylum Proteobacteria, such as Proteus, but the effect of subsequent disturbances was less pronounced, suggesting that the gut microbiome is affected by past disturbance events. Furthermore, although gut microbiome diversity did not recover, probiotic supplementation was effective in limiting cecum size enlargement and colonic inflammation caused by vancomycin. However, for amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin, the relative abundances of proinflammatory species were not greatly affected, and consequently, the effect of probiotic supplementation on community structure, cecum weight, and expression of inflammation-related genes was comparatively negligible. These results indicate that probiotic supplementation is effective, but only when antibiotics cause proinflammatory species-induced gut inflammation, suggesting that the necessity of probiotic supplementation is strongly influenced by the type of disturbance introduced to the community. © Copyright © 2020 Ojima, Gotoh, Takada, Odamaki, Xiao, Katoh and Katayama.",9.0

Two Bifidobacterium strains (LI09 and LI10) were found to alleviate D-galactosamine-induced liver damage (LD) in rats in our previous work. A series of bioinformatic and statistical analyses were performed to determine the vital bacteria in the gut microbiotas altered by the LI09 or LI10 in rats. Results: Two groups of representative phylotypes could distinguish the gut microbiotas of LI09 or LI10 groups from the other groups. Among them, OTU170-Porphyromonadaceae acted as a gatekeeper in LI09 group, while OTU12-Bacteroides was determined with multiple correlations in the gut network of LI10 group. Multiple reduced OTUs associated with LC and increased OTUs associated with health were determined in LI09 or LI10 groups, among which, increased OTU51-Barnesiella and reduced OTU99-Barnesiella could be associated with the protective effects of both the two probiotics. The gut microbiotas in LI09, LI10 and positive control groups were clustered into three clusters, i.e., Cluster-1-Microbiota, Cluster-2-Microbiota and Cluster-3-Microbiota, by Partition Around Medoids clustering analysis. Cluster-2-Microbiota was determined at least dysbiotic status due to its greatest LD dysbiosis ratio, lowest levels of liver function variables and plasma cytokines compared with the two other clustered microbiotas, suggesting the treated rats in Cluster-2 were at better health status. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that OTU170-Porphyromonadaceae and OTU12-Bacteroides are vital in the gut microbiotas altered by LI09 and LI10. Characteristics of the LD cohorts treated by LI09 or LI10 at different gut microbial colonization states could help monitor the cohorts' health status. © 2020 The Author(s).",4.0

However, their effect on the microbiome of cirrhosis patients is not fully understood yet. Here, we tested the effects of a multispecies probiotic on microbiome composition in compensated cirrhosis. The gut microbiome composition of 58 patients with compensated cirrhosis from a randomized controlled trial who received a daily dose of multispecies probiotics or placebo for six months was analysed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Microbiome composition of patients who received probiotics was enriched with probiotic strains and the abundance of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Syntrophococcus sucromutans, Bacteroides vulgatus, Alistipes shahii and a Prevotella species was increased in the probiotic group compared to the placebo group. Patients who had microbiome changes in response to probiotic treatment also showed a significant increase in neopterin and a significant decrease in faecal zonulin levels after intervention, which was not observed in placebo-treated patients or patients with unchanged microbiome compositions. In conclusion, multispecies probiotics may enrich the microbiome of compensated cirrhotic patients with probiotic bacteria during a six-month intervention and beneficially change the residential microbiome and gut barrier function. © 2020 by the authors.

Corneal ulcers are a common eye inflammatory disease that can cause visual impairment or even blindness if not treated promptly. Ocular trauma is a major risk factor for corneal ulcers, and corneal trauma in agricultural work can rapidly progress to corneal ulcers. This study aims to evaluate the changes in the ocular surface (OS) microbiome of patients with traumatic corneal ulcer (TCU). METHODS. Among 20 healthy control (HC) subjects and 22 patients with TCU, 42 eyes were examined to investigate the OS microbial flora using metagenomic shotgun sequencing. RESULTS. At the taxonomic composition level, our findings showed that dysbiosis (alterations in richness and community structure) occurs in the OS microbiome of patients with TCU. Notably, Pseudomonas was present at a greater than 30% relative abundance in all individuals in the TCU group. At the species level, the abundance of Pseudomonas fluorescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was significantly elevated in the TCU group compared to the HC group. At the functional level, we identified significant differences in the HC and TCU groups. We observed that inflammation-related pathways involved in bacterial chemotaxis, flagellar assembly, and biofilm formation were significantly more abundant in the TCU group. Besides, the pathways related to biosynthesis, degradation, and metabolism were also increased significantly in the TCU group. CONCLUSIONS. These findings indicate an altered OS microbiome in the affected eyes of patients with TCU. Further research is needed to determine whether these alterations contribute to the pathogenesis of TCU or impact disease progression. © 2020 Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Inc..

Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into a normal diet group (A), a high-fat diet group (B), a skim milk diet group (C), and an L. plantarum WW FSM diet group (D). After 12-wk feeding, we found that treatment with L. plantarum WW FSM could significantly alleviate symptoms in the pathological group. Meanwhile, high-throughput sequencing analysis showed that L. plantarum WW FSM also had a certain regulatory effect on the intestinal microorganisms in rats, which can increase the number of lactic acid bacteria and Bacteroides in the intestine. More importantly, real-time quantitative PCR and Western blot analysis showed that the probiotic was also involved in the expression of genes related to fat metabolism, especially the PPARB and CEBPB genes.

Methods and Results: Of the 128 isolates, Lactobacillus plantarum BLPL03 was selected based on its excellent acid and bile salt tolerance properties. Lactobacillus plantarum BLPL03 was sensitive to β-lactams, macrolides, amphenicols and cephalosporins, whereas it displayed the steady resistance to aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, quinolones and peptide antibiotics. In vitro analysis of antibacterial activities showed that L. plantarum BLPL03 inhibited the four common food-borne pathogenic bacteria including Escherichia coli O157:H7 CMCC 44828, Salmonella Typhimurium ATCC 13311, Staphylococcus aureus CMCC 26003 and Listeria monocytogenes CMCC 54007 in synergy with nZnO. Furthermore, the quantitative polymerase chain reaction test demonstrated that the combined administration of L. plantarum BLPL03 fermentation liquor (LFL) and nZnO synergistically elevated the faecal number of Bifidobacterium by 73·19-fold, and reduced the two potential enteropathogenic bacteria Enterobacteriaceae and Clostridium perfringens in mice challenged with Salm. Typhimurium. Finally, dietary supplementation with low dose of nZnO (20 mg kg−1) when combined with LFL administration enhanced final body weight, fur appearance and average daily gain, and decreased feed conversion ratio and diarrhoea incidence in weaned piglets. The faecal Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus of piglets were dramatically enhanced by 81·96- and 3·15-fold, respectively, after administration of a mixture of nZnO and LFL. Meanwhile, combination of nZnO with LFL resulted in low levels of Bacteroides, Enterococcus, and Enterobacteriaceae. Conclusions: A combination of nZnO and LFL exhibits potential health-benefit properties for the control of gut microbial composition by their synergistic antimicrobial and probiotic effects.

The mulberry silkworm, Bombyx mori (Lepidoptera), harbors several bacteria in its midgut aiding the metabolic processes; however, the variability of bacterial spp. present in the midgut and their role(s) in the growth and development of the silkworm are poorly understood. The present work compares the diversity of midgut bacterial communities in silkworms of variable voltinism (Pure Mysore, PM: multivoltine; CSR2: bivoltine and PM × CSR2: crossbreed) through metagenomics. The predominance of Enterococcus (30.30%) followed by Bacillus (16.96%) was observed in PM, whereas Lactobacillus (56.56%) followed by Enterococcus (10.58%) was seen only in CSR2. Interestingly, crossbreed midgut harbored diverse bacterial communities (36.21% Lactobacillus, 25.94% Bacillus, 8.1% Enterococcus, and 18.37% uncultured bacteria). Metagenomic profiles indicate variability in the gut bacterial population in different kinds of silkworms influencing the physiological activities accordingly. The dominant bacteria, particularly lactobacilli, bacilli, and enterococci could be further explored for identifying the potential probiotic consortia based on a literature survey and potential involvement in nutrient absorption, disease/stress tolerance, and improved economic traits. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",6.0
"Gomes A.C., Hoffmann C., Mota J.F.",Gut microbiota is associated with adiposity markers and probiotics may impact specific genera,2020,European Journal of Nutrition,10.1007/s00394-019-02034-0,"Purpose: It has been suggested that restoring gut microbiota alterations with probiotics represents a potential clinical target for the treatment of gut microbiota-related diseases, such as obesity. Here, we apply 16S rDNA microbiota profiling to establish which bacteria in the human gut are associated with obesity and cardiometabolic risk factors, and to evaluate whether probiotic supplementation modulates gut microbiota. Methods: We evaluated the effects of a probiotic mixture (2 × 1010 CFU/day of Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-14, Lactobacillus casei LC-11, Lactococcus lactis LL-23, Bifidobacterium bifidum BB-06, and Bifidobacterium lactis BL-4) in 32 overweight or obese women in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Using 16S rDNA sequencing, we characterized fecal samples and investigated the relationships between microbiome data and diet, body composition, antioxidant enzymes, and inflammatory profile. In addition, we characterized the degree of variation among fecal communities after the intervention. Results: BMI, weight, fat mass, lean mass, conicity index, protein intake, monounsaturated fat intake, glycated hemoglobin, TNF-α, and IL6/IL10 were significantly correlated with microbiome composition. The candidate division TM7 was strongly associated with all adiposity markers and Clostridiaceae associated negatively with TNF-α. The family Clostridiaceae increased and TM7 tended to decrease after the probiotic mixture supplementation. Subjects were clustered according to body composition, and a higher proportion of TM7 was observed in those with higher adiposity. Conclusions: Ecosystem-wide analysis of probiotic use effects on the gut microbiota revealed a genera specific influence, and one of which (TM7) represents a promising novel target for obesity treatment.

Thirty male Swiss albino mice were divided into five groups: control (C), malnourished (M), probiotic fermented milk (PFM), skim milk (SM), and bacterial suspension (BS) with six mice per group. Group C was fed with conventional diet throughout the study while the other groups were fed with protein calorie restricted diet until the development of malnutrition. After development of malnutrition, group M was continued with the restricted diet while other groups were fed with re-nourished diet supplemented with PFM, SM, and BS for 1 week, respectively. Thereafter, mice were sacrificed and different histological, microbiological, and immunological parameters were studied. Probiotics feeding in PEM model as fermented product or bacterial suspension improved the intestinal health in terms of intact morphology of colonic crypts, normal goblet cells, and intact lamina propria with no inflammation in large intestine, absence of fibrosis, and no inflammation in spleen. The number of secretory IgA+ cells was significantly higher in group PFM and BS. Also, increase in the phagocytic percentage of the macrophages and bone marrow derived dendritic cells (DCs) were observed in the PFM and BS group in comparison to the group M. In comparison to the group M and SM, lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, and Firmicutes counts were significantly higher in the group PFM and BS. This study concludes that probiotic supplementation to re-nutrition diet could emerge as wonder therapeutics against PEM. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",6.0

The relationship between the shrimp midgut microbial community and blue body syndrome is, however, unclear. In this study, we collected midgut and seawater samples from ponds with healthy and diseased shrimp to understand variations in bacterial communities in the midguts of healthy or diseased shrimp from the same habitat. The expression level of penaeidin, lectin, crustins, and defensin in shrimp with blue body syndrome were decreased, compared to those of healthy shrimp, indicating that shrimp with blue body syndrome have a lower autoimmune. 16 s sequencing analysis found that total 37 phyla, 91 classes, 160 orders, 221 families and 373 genera was detected. Among them, Proteobacteria (55.7%), Cyanobacteria (30.5%), Bacteroides (5.4%), Actinomycetes (1.1%) and Trichomes (0.9%) are the core bacteria in the intestinal bacteria of Penaeus vannamei. The intestinal bacterial communities are closely associated with the severity of shrimp disease. This pattern was further evidenced by NMDS and LEfSe analyses that were significantly different in abundance between healthy and diseased shrimp. In addition, we found that within a given bacterial genus, the patterns of enrichment or decrease were inconsistent with the known probiotics functions of those bacteria. These results suggested that the composition disorders and immunity decrease of intestinal microbiota were closely associated with shrimp blue body syndrome. Moreover, the identified bacterial genus can be used as an indicator taxa to evaluate the occurrence probability of blue body syndrome in shrimp. © 2020",6.0

Therefore, we examined the gut microbial composition and mechanisms of interaction with the host in relation to homoeostatic energy metabolism and pathophysiology of dysbiosis-induced metabolic inflammation and obesity. We also discussed the eubiotic, health-promoting effects of probiotics and prebiotics as well as epigenetic modifications associated with gut microbial dysbiosis and risk of obesity. High-fat/carbohydrate diet programmes the gut microbiota to one predominated by Firmicutes (Clostridium), Prevotella and Methanobrevibacter but deficient in beneficial genera/species such as Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus and Akkermansia. Altered gut microbiota is associated with decreased expression of SCFA that maintain intestinal epithelial barrier integrity, reduce bacterial translocation and inflammation and increase expression of hunger-suppressing hormones. Reduced amounts of beneficial micro-organisms also inhibit fasting-induced adipocyte factor expression leading to dyslipidaemia. A low-grade chronic inflammation (metabolic endotoxaemia) ensues which culminates in obesity and its co-morbidities. The synergy of high-fat diet and dysbiotic gut microbiota initiates a recipe that epigenetically programmes the host for increased adiposity and poor glycaemic control. Interestingly, these obesogenic mechanistic pathways that are transmittable from one generation to another can be modulated through the administration of probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics. Though the influence of gut microbiota on the risk of obesity and several intervention strategies have been extensively demonstrated in animal models, application in humans still requires further robust investigation. © The Authors 2020.",45.0

Studies have demonstrated that estrogen deficiency-associated bone loss is microbiota-dependent and could be prevented by probiotics and prebiotics. In this study, we report that orally administered lactulose (20 g/kg, 6 weeks) orally administered significantly inhibited osteoclastogenesis, bone resorption, and prevented ovariectomy (OVX)-induced bone loss in mice. Lactulose increased intestinal Claudin 2, 3 and 15, compared to the OVX group, and lowered pro-osteoclastogenic cytokines levels including tumor necrosis factorα, interleukin(IL)-6, receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-Β ligand (RANKL), and IL-17 as well as increased the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in the intestine, peripheral blood, and bone marrow. Lactulose significantly preserved the number of Foxp3+ Treg cells in the intestines compared with that in OVX mice. Lactulose altered the composition of intestinal microbiota measured by 16s rDNA sequencing and increased intestinal and serum short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) levels including acetate, propionate and butyrate which were decreased in OVX mice as measured by gas chromatography. Oral administration of lactulose for 2 weeks significantly lowered the level of bone resorption marker C-telopeptide of type 1 collagen-1 in healthy male young volunteers (aging 20-25 years). In conclusion, lactulose inhibited osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption by altering the intestinal microbiota and increasing SCFAs. Lactulose could serve as an ideal therapeutic agent for postmenopausal osteoporosis. Copyright: © 2019 Chen X et al.

The relationship between probiotics and gut enterotype is not yet clear. Cayenne pepper is effective in vitro as a prebiotic for Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli, so cayenne ingestion with probiotics may lead to more profound gut microbial shifts. We aimed to determine whether probiotics (with or without cayenne pepper) alter gut bacterial community composition and if these changes are associated with the original gut enterotype of the individual. A total of 27 adult participants provided three fecal samples: prior to probiotic treatment (baseline), post probiotic treatment (probiotic), and post probiotic plus cayenne pepper treatment (probiotic + cayenne). DNA was extracted, amplified, and the V4 region sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform using V2 chemistry. Sequence reads were processed in mothur and assigned using the SILVA reference by phylotype. Three enterotypes characterized the study population—Bacteroides (B; n = 6), Prevotella (P; n = 11), and Ruminoccocus (R; n = 10). There was no significant increase in probiotic genera in fecal samples after treatment periods. Alpha diversity scores were significantly lower in B-type but not in P- or R-type individuals after probiotic treatment. For the majority of individuals, their enterotype remained constant regardless of probiotic (and cayenne) treatment. This suggests that baseline gut community characteristics and enterotype classification influence responsiveness to probiotic treatment, but that enterotype is stable across administration of prebiotic and probiotics. Practical Application: A person's gut microbial community influences their responsiveness to probiotics and prebiotic ingredients. Consumers must understand that it is difficult to shift their gut microbiota even with simultaneous administration of prebiotic and probiotic. Greater understanding of these phenomena will enable consumers to choose the most efficacious products for their needs. © 2020 Institute of Food Technologists®",5.0

A total of 180 1-day-old broilers were randomly assigned into two groups with six replicates of 15 birds in each. The birds were offered two diets consisted one control, i.e., supplemented with 0% FCSM (CON) and an experimental, with 6% FCSM (FCSM). Illumina MiSeq sequencing and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry were used to investigate the profile changes of the cecum microbes and metabolites and the interactions among fat deposition, microbes, and metabolites. Results showed that at the age of 21 days, both the abdominal fat and subcutaneous fat thickness of the experimental birds decreased significantly (P < 0.05) in response to the dietary FCSM supplementation. The predominant microbial flora in cecum consisted Bacteroidetes (53.55%), Firmicutes (33.75%), and Proteobacteria (8.61%). FCSM diet increased the relative abundance of Bacteroides but decreased obese microbial including Faecalibacterium, Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Anaerofilum. Cecum metabolomics analysis revealed that lipids, organic acids, vitamins, and peptides were significantly altered by adding FCSM in diet. Correlation analysis showed that abdominal fat and subcutaneous fat thickness related negatively with Bacteroides while the same related positively with Faecalibacterium, Lachnospiraceae, and Ruminococcaceae. Moreover, abdominal fat and subcutaneous fat thickness were related negatively with nicotinic acid, sebacic acid, thymidine, and succinic acid. These findings indicated that FCSM reduced the fat deposition by regulating cecum microbiota and metabolites in broilers. The results are contributory to the development of probiotics and the improvement in the production of broilers. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",7.0

A dihydroquinoline analog of agomelatine (AGO), N-(2-(7-methoxy-3,4-dihydroisoquinolin-1-yl)ethyl)acetamide hydrochloride (NMDEA), was synthesized by employing a scaffold-hopping strategy in our previous study. In this study, NMDEA was demonstrated to attenuate depression-related behaviors in mice models of chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS), using a sucrose preference test, a forced swimming test, and a tail suspension test. However, the antidepressant mechanism of NMDEA appears to differ from that for AGO. Based on the analysis of fecal microbiota from mice, stress can alter the richness of the gut bacterial community, increasing the expression of immune-modulating microbiota, such as Clostridia, and decreasing the expression of probiotic bacteria, such as Lactobacillus. Treatment with NMDEA was able to recover the richness and to regulate the dysbiosis among bacterial species. Several studies have demonstrated that the gut microbiota population can induce inflammatory processes. To explore the effects of NMDEA on the suppression of pro-inflammatory factors, we used Western blotting to analyze the levels of interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), interleukin 6 (IL-6), p65, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). NMDEA suppressed the activation of IL-1β and IL-6, in the hippocampus, and IL-1β, IL-6, p65, and iNOS, in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced BV-2 cells. These results suggested that NMDEA may affect the microbiota-inflammasome-brain axis, regulating relevant neuro-inflammatory markers and gut microbiota. Our data also suggested that using small molecules to modify the gut microbiota population or alter inflammasome signaling may represent a new therapeutic opportunity for the mitigation of depression. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",3.0

Methods: Mice were divided into 11 models (4 mice per model): 6 uninoculated models and 5 models inoculated with C. difficile BI/NAP1/027. Inoculated models were prepared using intraperitoneal clindamycin followed by inoculation with C. difficile BI/NAP1/027. Uninoculated and C. difficile-inoculated mice received 2 or 7 days’ vancomycin or fidaxomicin. Clostridium butyricum MIYAIRI 588 probiotic and lactoferrin prebiotic were administered for 10 days to uninoculated mice. Intestinal microbiome composition was investigated by sequence analyses of bacterial 16S rRNA genes from faeces, and microbiota diversity estimated. Results: In uninoculated, untreated (‘normal’) mice, Clostridia (57.8%) and Bacteroidia (32.4%) accounted for the largest proportions of gut microbiota. The proportion of Clostridia was numerically reduced in C. difficile-inoculated versus normal mice. Administration of vancomycin to C. difficile-inoculated mice reduced the proportions of Bacteroidia and Clostridia, and increased that of Proteobacteria. Administration of fidaxomicin to C. difficile-inoculated mice reduced the proportion of Clostridia to a lesser extent, but increased that of Bacteroidia. Microbiota diversity was lower in C. difficile-inoculated versus normal mice (164.5 versus 349.1 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), respectively); treatment of C. difficile-inoculated mice with 7 days' vancomycin reduced diversity to a greater extent than did 7 days' fidaxomicin treatment (26.2 versus 134.2 OTUs, respectively). Conclusions: Both C. difficile inoculation and treatment with vancomycin or fidaxomicin reduced microbiota diversity; however, dysbiosis associated with fidaxomicin was milder than with vancomycin. © 2020 Japanese Society of Chemotherapy and The Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases",7.0

Results showed that CSP stimulated cytokines secretion (IL-12, IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-13, IL-6, IL-17, IL-10, TGF-β3, TNF-α, IL-2, IL-21) and transcription factors production (T-bet, GATA-3, RORγt, Foxp3). TLRs (TLR-2, TLR-4, TLR-6) and NF-κB pathway key proteins (p-IκB-α, NF-κB p65) were also upregulated after CSP administration. Moreover, CSP recovered SCFAs levels which decreased by Cy treatment. Furthermore, 16S rRNA sequencing of fecal samples was performed. α-diversity and β-diversity analysis revealed CSP improved microbial community diversity and modulated the overall structure of gut microbiota. Taxonomic composition analysis found that CSP increased the abundance of probiotics (Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides) and decreased pathogenic bacteria (Clostridium, Flexispira). These findings suggested the potential of CSP as a prebiotics to reduce side effects of Cy on intestinal mucosal immunity and gut microbiota. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",47.0

We investigate the potential changes of 5-FU treatment and the modulations of probiotics on gut microbiota in a mouse model. Methods: Male BALB/c mice received either 5-FU or saline (S). They were separated and fed saline, Lactobacillus casei variety rhamnosus (Lcr) and Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 (BG). Lcr and BG were simultaneously administered with 5-FU for 5 days. Stool specimens were collected for DNA extraction and pyrosequenced for bioinformatic analysis. Results: Fecal microbial communities were obviously diverse. Bacteroides and Bacteroidaceae were the most abundant microbiota in FU.BG group while S24_7 was the most in S.S group. At phylum and class levels, abundances of Betaproteobacteria, Erysipelotrichi, Gammaproteobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia were significantly increased in the FU groups. Probiotics supplementation did increase the abundances of Enterobacteriales and Turicibacterales. We demonstrated that probiotics did modulate the abundance and diversity of gut microbiota. Bacterial motility proteins were found enriched and upregulated in the S.BG group. No mortality was noted. No bacterial translocation was found in spleen and blood among the six groups. Conclusion: Gut microbiota of mice undergoing chemotherapy exhibited a distinct disruption in bacterial composition. Probiotic did modulate the abundance and diversity of gut microbiota.

However, it is not clear whether C. butyricum could improve lipid metabolism through shaping gut microbiota and bile acid (BA) profile of laying hens. We aimed to evaluate the contributions of gut microbiota and BA profile to the potential effect of C. butyricum on lipid metabolism of aged laying hens. A total of 192 60-week-old Hy-Line Brown laying hens were divided into two groups (eight replicates per group). Birds were fed a basal diet supplemented with 0 or 2.7 g/kg C. butyricum (1.0 × 109 CFU/g). Samples were collected at the end of week 8 of the experiment. The results showed elevated (P &lt; 0.05) concentrations of glucagon-like peptide 1, insulin and thyroid hormones in serum responded to C. butyricum addition, which also decreased (P &lt; 0.05) hepatic free fatty acids contents, as well as increased (P &lt; 0.05) the expression of hepatic acyl-CoA oxidase, farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and PPARα. C. butyricum addition increased (P &lt; 0.05) Bacteroidetes abundance but tended to decrease (P &lt; 0.10) Firmicutes abundance in the ileum. Besides, C. butyricum addition resulted in higher (P &lt; 0.05) abundances of Clostridia (Clostridiales) and Prevotellaceae, concurrent with an increasing trend (P &lt; 0.10) of Bifidobacteriaceae abundance and decreased the abundances of several harmful bacteria such as Klebsiella (P &lt; 0.05).

We apply our method to the International Sinonasal Microbiome Study (ISMS) dataset of 410 sinus swab samples. We propose three main sinonasal “microbiotypes” or “states”: the first is Corynebacterium-dominated, the second is Staphylococcus-dominated, and the third dominated by the other core genera of the sinonasal microbiome (Streptococcus, Haemophilus, Moraxella, and Pseudomonas). The prevalence of the three microbiotypes studied did not differ between healthy and diseased sinuses, but differences in their distribution were evident based on geography. We also describe a potential reciprocal relationship between Corynebacterium species and Staphylococcus aureus, suggesting that a certain microbial equilibrium between various players is reached in the sinuses. We validate our approach by applying it to a separate 16S rRNA gene sequence dataset of 97 sinus swabs from a different patient cohort. Sinonasal microbiotyping may prove useful in reducing the complexity of describing sinonasal microbiota.

Mice were orally treated with 3% (w/v) DSS or not for 7 days, followed by drug treatment with TH-GLs or sulfasalazine. After treatment, macroscopic colitis symptoms, intestinal epithelial barrier function, inflammatory cytokines, and gut microbiota homeostasis were assessed. Further studies showed that TH-GLs and sulfasalazine showed different influences on the gut microbiota structure. Both sulfasalazine and TH-GLs decreased the DSS-induced enrichment of Gammaproteobacteria and Enterobacteriaceae. However, TH-GLs had a selective increase in the enrichment of Akkermansia, Prevotellaceae, Oscillospira, Allobaculum, Bifidobacterium, and Coprococcus in contrast to sulfasalazine, which selectively increased the enrichment of Dorea, Turicibacter, Bacteroides, Coprobacillus, Mucispirillum, and Dehalobacterium. In addition, both TH-GLs and sulfasalazine relieved body weight loss, and increased the immune organ index, while maintaining the balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. The results indicate that TH-GLs alleviate DSS-induced IBD in mice by decreasing the abundance of harmful gut microbiota and enhancing the abundance of probiotic gut microbiota. Thus, the mechanism through which TH-GLs inhibit inflammation through gut microbiota is different from that of sulfasalazine. Therefore, TH-GLs stand as potential prebiotics for the treatment of colonic inflammation and related diseases. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",14.0

Dysbiotic microbiota with enhanced proinflammatory capacity is characterized by depletion of anaerobic commensals, increased proportion of facultatively anaerobic bacteria, as well as reduced diversity and stability. In this study, we developed a high-throughput in vitro screening assay to isolate intestinal commensal bacteria with anti-inflammatory capacity from a healthy fecal microbiota transplantation donor. Freshly isolated gut bacteria were screened for their capacity to attenuate Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced interleukin 8 (IL-8) release from HT-29 cells. The screen yielded a number of Bacteroides and Parabacteroides isolates, which were identified as P. distasonis, B. caccae, B. intestinalis, B. uniformis, B. fragilis, B. vulgatus and B. ovatus using whole genome sequencing. We observed that a cell-cell contact with the epithelium was not necessary to alleviate in vitro inflammation as spent culture media from the isolates were also effective and the anti-inflammatory action did not correlate with the enterocyte adherence capacity of the isolates. The anti-inflammatory isolates also exerted enterocyte monolayer reinforcing action and lacked essential genes to synthetize hexa-acylated, proinflammatory lipid A, part of LPS. Yet, the anti-inflammatory effector molecules remain to be identified.

The genus Bacillus was one of dominant probiotics, which was commonly used in aquaculture. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of dietary administration of Bacillus cereus (B. cereus) on bioaccumulation, oxidative stress and intestinal microbiota of Carassius auratus gibelio (C. gibelio) after Cd exposure. Fish were exposed for 4 weeks to waterborne Cd at 0, 1 and 2 mg/L and/or dietary B. cereus at 108 cfu/g. At 2 and 4 weeks, the fish were sampled and bioaccumulation, antioxidant activity and intestinal microbiota were assessed. Waterborne Cd exposure caused marked alterations in the composition of the microbiota. Dietary supplementation with B. cereus can reverse the changes in the composition of intestinal microbiota in Cd exposure and increase the abundance of Bacteroides, Akkermansia, Cetobacterium in the 0 and 1 mg/L Cd. The results obtained indicate that B. cereus can provide a significant protective effect on the toxicity of cadmium by inhibiting alterations in the levels of bioaccumulation and antioxidant enzyme including Superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), total antioxidant (T-AOC), glutathione (GSH), malonaldehyde (MDA) and Glutathione-S-transferase (GST).

A total of 200 piglets 35 days old were randomly allocated to 5 groups, 4 replications in each group, and 10 piglets in each replication. Group A was the basal diet; group B was supplemented with antibiotics and zinc oxide; groups C, D and E were supplemented with 0.06%, 0.12% and 0.18% CPB, respectively. The experimental period was 42 d. The results indicated that there were no significant differences in average daily feed intake (ADFI), average daily gain (ADG) and feed conversion rate (FCR) among five groups (p > 0.05). However, mortality, diarrhea and rejection rates in the control group were higher than that in other groups. CPB could increase protein digestibility and serum IgG content (p < 0.05), while it could decrease serum urea nitrogen content and alkaline phosphatase activity (p < 0.05). Analysis of fecal microbiota showed that the relative abundances of Bacteroides and Firmicutes were increased, while the relative abundances of opportunistic pathogens such as Spirochaetae and Protebactreria were dramatically decreased in piglets fed with CPB or antibiotics, compared with the control group. Furthermore, CPB intervention increased the relative abundances of Prevotella_9, Megasphaera and Prevotella_2, while decreased the relative abundance of Prevotellaceae_NK3B31_group. Correlation analysis revealed that there was good correlation between serum indexes and fecal microbiota. It was suggested that CPB might be a promising antibiotic alternative for improving piglet health and immunity, decreasing mortality by positively altering gut microbiota. © 2020 by the authors.

Human gut microbiota has different community structures. Because gut microbial composition is assumed to be linked to probiotic function, this study evaluated the efficacy of probiotics on obesity-related clinical markers according to gut microbial enterotype. Methods: Fifty subjects with body mass index over 25 kg/m2 were randomly assigned to either the probiotic or placebo group. Each group received either unlabeled placebo or probiotic capsules for 12 weeks. Body weight, waist circumference, and body composition were measured every 3 weeks. Using computed tomography, total abdominal fat area and visceral fat area were measured. Blood and fecal samples were collected before and after the intervention for biochemical parameters and gut microbial compositions analysis. Results: Gut microbial compositions of all the subjects were classified into two enterotypes according to Prevotella/Bacteroides ratio. The fat percentage, blood glucose, and insulin significantly increased in the Prevotella-rich enterotype of the placebo group. The obesity-related markers, such as waist circumference, total fat area, visceral fat, and ratio of visceral to subcutaneous fat area, were significantly reduced in the probiotic group. The decrease of obesity-related markers was greater in the Prevotella-rich enterotype than in the Bacteroides-rich enterotype. Conclusion: Administration of probiotics improved obesity-related markers in obese people, and the efficacy of probiotics differed per gut microbial enterotype and greater responses were observed in the Prevotella-dominant enterotype. © 2020, European Association for Predictive, Preventive and Personalised Medicine (EPMA).",17.0

Methods: To figure out whether probiotics can sustain intestinal homeostasis and guard people's health, the probiotic drug of Bifidobacterium Tetragenous viable Bacteria Tablets (P group, n = 16) or placebo (C group, n = 16) was used for volunteers receiving bowel preparation, and high-throughput sequencing method was applied to monitor their intestinal microbial changes. Results: The present results suggested that bowel preparation obviously reduced the intestinal microbial diversity, while taking probiotics significantly restored it to normal level. In addition, probiotics sharply reduced the abundance of pathogenic Proteobacteria, and obviously lowered the ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes compared with control group at phylum level (P < 0.05). And probiotics markedly decreased the abundance of pathogenic Acinetobacter and Streptococcus, while greatly enriched the relative abundance of beneficial bacteria Bacteroides, Roseburia, Faecalibacterium, and Parabacteroides at genus level (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Probiotic drugs, e.g., Bifidobacterium Tetragenous viable Bacteria Tablets, can be used to restore intestinal dysbacteriosis caused by bowel preparation, and reduce side effects during colonoscopy. © Copyright © 2020 Deng, Tian, Yang, Han, Wei, Zheng, Liu and Chen.",6.0

Yet whether gut microbiota dysbiosis participates in the etiology of GDM remains largely unknown. Objectives: Our study was initiated to determine whether the alternations in gut microbial composition during early pregnancy linked to the later development of GDM, and explore the feasibility of microbial biomarkers for the early prediction of GDM. Study design: This nested case-control study was based upon an early pregnancy follow-up cohort (ChiCTR1900020652). Gut microbiota profiles of 98 subjects with GDM and 98 matched healthy controls during the early pregnancy (10–15 weeks) were assessed via 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of V4 region. The data set was randomly split into a discovery set and a validation set, the former was used to analyze the differences between GDM cases and controls in gut microbial composition and functional annotation, and to establish an early identification model of GDM, then the performance of the model was verified by the external validation set. Results: Bioinformatic analyses revealed changes to gut microbial composition with significant differences in relative abundance between the groups. Specifically, Eisenbergiella, Tyzzerella 4, and Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 were enriched in the GDM group, whereas Parabacteroides, Megasphaera, Eubacterium eligens group, etc. remained dominant in the controls. Correlation analysis revealed that GDM-enriched genera Eisenbergiella and Tyzzerella 4 were positively correlated with fasting blood glucose levels, while three control-enriched genera (Parabacteroides, Parasutterella, and Ruminococcaceae UCG 002) were the opposite. Further, GDM functional annotation modules revealed enrichment of modules for sphingolipid metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism, etc., while lysine biosynthesis and nitrogen metabolism were reduced. Finally, five genera and two clinical indices were included in the linear discriminant analysis model for the prediction of GDM; the areas under receiver operating characteristic curves of the training and validation sets were 0.736 (95% confidence interval: 0.663–0.808) and 0.696 (0.575–0.818), respectively. Conclusions: Gut bacterial dysbiosis in early pregnancy was found to be associated with the later development of GDM, and gut microbiota-targeted biomarkers might be utilized as potential predictors of GDM. © Copyright © 2020 Ma, You, Huang, Long, Zhang, Guo, Zhang, Wu, Xiao and Tan.",31.0
"Adamberg K., Raba G., Adamberg S.",Use of Changestat for Growth Rate Studies of Gut Microbiota,2020,Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology,10.3389/fbioe.2020.00024,"Human colon microbiota, composed of hundreds of different species, is closely associated with several health conditions. Controlled in vitro cultivation and up-to-date analytical methods make possible the systematic evaluation of the underlying mechanisms of complex interactions between the members of microbial consortia. Information on reproducing fecal microbial consortia can be used for various clinical and biotechnological applications. In this study, chemostat and changestat cultures were used to elucidate the effects of the physiologically relevant range of dilution rates on the growth and metabolism of adult fecal microbiota. The dilution rate was kept either at D = 0.05 or D = 0.2 1/h in chemostat cultures, while gradually changing from 0.05 to 0.2 1/h in the A-stat and from 0.2 to 0.05 1/h in the De-stat. Apple pectin as a substrate was used in the chemostat experiments and apple pectin or birch xylan in the changestat experiments, in the presence of porcine mucin in all cases. The analyses were comprised of HPLC for organic acids, UPLC for amino acids, GC for gas composition, 16S-rDNA sequencing for microbial composition, and growth parameter calculations. It was shown that the abundance of most bacterial taxa was determined by the dilution rate on both substrates. Bacteroides ovatus, Bacteroides vulgatus, and Faecalibacterium were prevalent within the whole range of dilution rates. Akkermansia muciniphila and Ruminococcaceae UCG-013 were significantly enriched at D = 0.05 1/h, while Bacteroides caccae, Lachnospiraceae unclassified and Escherichia coli clearly preferred D = 0.2 1/h. In the chemostat cultures, the production of organic acids and gases from pectin was related to the dilution rate. The ratio of acetate, propionate and butyrate was 5:2:1 (D = 0.05 1/h) and 14:2:1 (D = 0.2 1/h). It was shown that the growth rate-related characteristics of the fecal microbiota were concise in both directions between D = 0.05 and 0.2 1/h. Reproducible adaptation of the fecal microbiota was shown in the continuous culture with a changing dilution rate: changestat. Consortia cultivation is a promising approach for research purposes and several biotechnological applications, including the production of multi-strain probiotics and fecal transplantation mixtures. © Copyright © 2020 Adamberg, Raba and Adamberg.",4.0

The safety assessment was conducted in male and female Wistar rats (n = 50) administered increasing doses (108 CFU/day, 109 CFU/day, or 1010 CFU/day) of B. uniformis CECT 7771, 1010 CFU/day of B. longum ATCC 15707T, which complies with the qualifying presumption of safety (QPS) status of the EU, or vehicle (placebo), as the control. Pancreatic, liver, and kidney functions and cytokine concentrations were analyzed. Bacterial translocation to peripheral tissues was evaluated, and colon integrity was investigated histologically. No adverse metabolic or tissue integrity alterations were associated with treatments; however, alanine aminotransferase levels and the ratio of anti-inflammatory to pro-inflammatory cytokines in serum indicated a potentially beneficial role of B. uniformis CECT 7771 at specific doses. Additionally, the microbial community structure was modified by the interventions, and potentially beneficial gut bacteria were increased.

Here, we provide intestinal flora changes of CKD patients undertook different hemodialysis therapy. Methods: From 2017 to 2019, a total of 166 patients from Guangzhou Red Cross Hospital were recruited and divided into four groups with 17 cases in healthy control group, 47 cases in CKD non-dialysis group, 49 cases in HD group, and 53 cases in PD group. Intestinal flora genome 16S rDNA sequencing and further bio-informatic analysis were performed. Results: Decreased diversity and altered communities of intestinal flora in PD patients, in which microbial diversity was positive correlated with the albumin level were observed. A total of 20 intestinal flora phyla were detected in 166 fecal samples, divided into 3 dominant intestinal types including Bacteroides-dominant gut type, Firmicutes-dominant type and Proteobacteria-dominant gut type. Further analyses found 198 genera, the abundance of 86 genera were significantly different. Butyrate-producing taxa as Faecalibacterium in genera level and Bifidobacteriaceae and Prevotellaceae in family level were dominant genus in CT, CKD, and HD groups, while urease containing-, indole- A nd p-cresol-forming taxa as Escherichia in genera and Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcaceae in family level was dominated genus in PD group. Number of differential expressed genes in KEGG enrichment pathways were significantly different in PD group in carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid metabolism, energy metabolism, translation, and membrane transport. Conclusion: Our results suggest peritoneal dialysis therapy could result in reduced diversity and altered microbial communities, with reduced probiotic butyrate-producing taxa and increased urease containing-, indole- A nd p-cresol-forming taxa.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 30 Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into three groups, namely, control group, model group, and probiotic group. The rats in the model group were prepared into models of collagen II-induced arthritis. Meanwhile, the rats in probiotic group were treated with probiotics for 6 weeks via intragastric administration in addition to the treatment in the model group. Next, the feces of rats in the control group, model group, and probiotic group were sampled to detect the composition of intestinal florae. In addition, peripheral blood was collected from rats to determine the changes in the content of inflammatory factors, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and IL-1β through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the levels of serum inflammatory factors TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β were significantly upregulated in the model group (p<0.05). This suggested successful modeling. However, they decreased notably in probiotic group when compared with the model group (p<0.05), indicating that probiotics could inhibit inflammatory response in rats. The levels of microbes Bacteroidetes, Streptococcus and Clostridiales were significantly higher in the control group (p<0.05). The levels of Ruminococcaceae, Asoccbarobacler, Coriobacteriaceae, and fecal anaerobic coryneform bacteria were remarkably higher in the model group (p<0.05). Meanwhile, the levels of Porphyromonadaceae, Barnsiella, Actinobacteria, Alloscardovia, Bifidobacteria and Parabacteroides were remarkably higher in probiotic group (p<0.05). The intestinal level of Bacteroides was the highest in rats of control group, which decreased significantly in the model group (p=0.000). However, the intestinal level of Bacteroides in probiotic group was overtly higher than that in the model group (p=0.000), whereas was lower than the control group. The intestinal level of Bifidobacteria in the model group was significantly lower than that in the control group (p=0.024). However, it was evidently higher in the probiotic group than that in both model group and control group (p=0.000). The intestinal level of Asoccbarobacler was remarkably higher in the model group than that in control group (p=0.005). However, it was lower in probiotic group than that in model group (p=0.003), showing the highest in model group. There was an evidently negative correlation between Firmicuteria and Clostridium (r=-0.82, p=0.000), and a positive association between Firmicuteria and Bacteroides (r=0.77, p=0.000). Bacteroides was negatively correlated with Clostridium (r=-0.89, p=0.002) and Enterococcus (r=-0.63, p=0.021). In addition, Enterococcus had a highly positive correlation with Clostridium (r=0.6, p=0.001).

Modern studies indicate that perturbations in the microbiome may be present in quite a few diseases, including inflammation and cancer. To be more specific, changes in the microbiomes of the gut and vagina may be related to various gynecologic cancers (cervical, uterine, and ovarian). Furthermore, the gastrointestinal microbiota can be altered by environmental factors and pre-existing morbidities and may cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, bloating, and abdominal pain. A healthy female gut microbiome is dominated by Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Bacteroides, Clostridium, Escherichia, Streptococcus, and Ruminococcus; the vaginal microbiome includes Firmicutes, specifically Lactobacilli spp. However, the gram-variable coccobacillus Gardnerella vaginalis (previously known as Haemophilus vaginalis) dominates the microbiota of biological vaginosis (BV) and includes several anaerobic organisms. Vaginal microbiota perturbations can cause vaginal pain, sexual dysfunction, and urinary symptoms. In the current review paper, we explore recent research along with existing gaps in knowledge related to the association of changes in microbiota diversity and the pathogenesis of vaginal infection–associated cervical cancer. © 2020 by Begell House, Inc.",

However, data on the effect of probiotics on gut microbiota and its association with childhood obesity is limited. This study aims to determine the effect of probiotics supplement intervention on gut microbiota profiles in obese and normal-weight children. A total of 37 children, 17 normal weight, and 20 overweight school children from a government school in Selangor were selected to participate in this study. Participants were further divided into intervention and control groups. The intervention groups received daily probiotic drinks while the control groups continued eating their typical diet. Fecal samples were collected from the participants for DNA extraction. The hypervariable V3 and V4 regions of 16S rRNA gene were amplified and sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform. No significant differences in alpha diversity were observed between normal weight and obese children in terms of the Shannon Index for evenness or species richness. However, a higher intervention effect on alpha diversity was observed among normal-weight participants compared to obese. The participants’ microbiome was found to fluctuate throughout the study. Analysis of the taxa at species level showed an increase in Bacteroides ovatus among the normal weight cohort. Genus-level comparison revealed a rise in genus Lachnospira and Ruminococcus in the overweight participants after intervention, compared to the normal-weight participants. The probiotics intervention causes an alteration in gut microbiota composition in both normal and overweight children.

This study aimed at investigating the effects of a probiotic supplement (Bacillus subtilis DE111) on the microbiome composition of preschool aged children attending day care. Healthy children aged 2-6 years old were randomised to receive either probiotic or placebo once a day for 8 weeks. No significant changes of the overall microbiome equilibrium were seen in between the two groups or from baseline to week 8. However, alpha diversity was increased in the probiotic group from baseline to week 8 (P<0.05), with no change in the placebo group. A decrease in the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio following probiotic supplementation (P<0.05) was also observed. Differential abundance analysis revealed an increase in Alistepes (P<0.01), Bacteroides (P<0.05), Parabacteroides (P<0.01), Odoribacter (P<0.001) and Rikenellaceae (P<0.001) in the probiotic group, most of which are involved in inflammation reduction.

Samples of colon microbiota from 62 patients undergoing programmed hemodialysis were studied before and after a course of diet therapy that included probiotic components, in particular, the immobilized synbiotic LB-complex L. Isolation of microorganisms was carried out according to our original method; for bacteria identification, a MALDI-TOF Autoflex speed mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonik, Germany) was used in the Biotyper program mode. The results were assessed using the criteria proposed by the authors and based on the OST 91500.11.0004-2003. The efficacy of the immobilized synbiotic was determined based on the clinical data, questionnaires, and bacteriological tests. Results. In patients receiving programmed hemodialysis (before the start of the diet therapy), chronic moderate inflammation and azotemia were found. Dysbiotic changes in microbiocenosis were revealed in all the examined patients; in the absence or suppression of lacto-and bifidoflora, the number and diversity of Bacteroides spp., Clostridium spp., Collinsella spp., Eggerthella spp. and other bacteria increased, which was consistent with the theory of functional redundancy of gut microbiota. From the answers to the questionnaires, a decrease in the quality of life was found (up to 70 points out of 100) according to six of the eight scales used. After the combined therapy using the synbiotic LB-complex L in the study group, 56% of the examined patients showed their microbiocenosis restored to normal; no grade III dysbiosis was detected in any patient. There was a significant decrease in CRP and ESR in these patients and an improvement in the quality of life by criteria reflecting physical health. Conclusion.

Using continuous culture anaerobic fermentor systems, we found that lactate concentrations remained low in communities of human colonic bacteria maintained at pH 6.5, even when DL-lactate was infused at 10 or 20 mM. In contrast, lower pH (5.5) led to periodic lactate accumulation following lactate infusion in three fecal microbial communities examined. Lactate accumulation was concomitant with greatly reduced butyrate and propionate production and major shifts in microbiota composition, with Bacteroidetes and anaerobic Firmicutes being replaced by Actinobacteria, lactobacilli, and Proteobacteria. Pure-culture experiments confirmed that Bacteroides and Firmicutes isolates were susceptible to growth inhibition by relevant concentrations of lactate and acetate, whereas the lactate-producer Bifidobacterium adolescentis was resistant. To investigate system behavior further, we used a mathematical model (microPop) based on 10 microbial functional groups. By incorporating differential growth inhibition, our model reproduced the chaotic behavior of the system, including the potential for lactate infusion both to promote and to rescue the perturbed system. The modeling revealed that system behavior is critically dependent on the proportion of the community able to convert lactate into butyrate or propionate. Communities with low numbers of lactate-utilizing bacteria are inherently less stable and more prone to lactate-induced perturbations. These findings can help us to understand the consequences of interindividual microbiota variation for dietary responses and microbiota changes associated with disease states. IMPORTANCE Lactate is formed by many species of colonic bacteria, and can accumulate to high levels in the colons of inflammatory bowel disease subjects. Conversely, in healthy colons lactate is metabolized by lactate-utilizing species to the short-chain fatty acids butyrate and propionate, which are beneficial for the host. Here, we investigated the impact of continuous lactate infusions (up to 20 mM) at two pH values (6.5 and 5.5) on human colonic microbiota responsiveness and metabolic outputs. At pH 5.5 in particular, lactate tended to accumulate in tandem with decreases in butyrate and propionate and with corresponding changes in microbial composition. Moreover, microbial communities with low numbers of lactate-utilizing bacteria were inherently less stable and therefore more prone to lactate-induced perturbations. These investigations provide clear evidence of the important role these lactate utilizers may play in health maintenance. These should therefore be considered as potential new therapeutic probiotics to combat microbiota perturbations. Copyright © 2020 Wang et al.

Methods: Fecal samples were collected from five healthy children (two boys and three girls; mean age, 7.52 ± 2.31 years). The children had no history of antibiotic use or intestinal microecological preparation in the preceding 3 months. Fresh fecal samples were collected from children to prepare gold juice in mid-to-late November, in accordance with traditional Chinese medicine methods, then used within 7 days. Finally, 16S rDNA sequence analysis was used to identify potentially effective bacterial components of gold juice. QIIME software was used for comparisons of microbial species among gold juice, diluent, filtrate, and loess samples. Results: Microflora of gold juice exhibited considerable changes following “ancient method” processing. Microbial components significantly differed between gold juice and filtrate samples. The gold juice analyzed in our study consisted of microbes that synthesize carbohydrates and amino acids by degrading substances, whereas the filtrate contained probiotic flora, Bacteroides, and Prevotella 9. Conclusions: This study of microbial components in gold juice and filtrate provided evidence regarding effective bacterial components in gold juice, which may aid in clinical decisions concerning fecal microbiota transplantation. © The Author(s) 2020.",

Methods: Seven bacterial strains associated with ASD, or with CDI and a control probiotic were tested for polyol inhibitory activity: Clostridium histolyticum, Bacteroides vulgatus, Bifidobacterium longham, and two strains each of Clostridium bolteae and difficile. Each strain was grown in brain heart infusion/sucrose media with polyol concentrations varying from 0% to 15% for erythritol and 0% -30 % for xylitol. Growth of Clostridium histolyticum and Bifidobacterium longham was measured after 24 hours while all other strains were evaluated at 48 hours to permit additional growth. Optical density was measured using a spectrophotometer and the plates were read at 620 nm. Results: All strains had results indicating polyol inhibition of growth. Clostridium histolyticum (Chis), Bifidobacterium longham (Blof), and both Clostridium bolteae (Cbol) strains showed reduced growth with increasing polyol concentration with an inflection point of about 4% for both xylitol and erythritol (complete or near complete inhibition relative to control wells). Bacteroides vulgatus (Bvul) grew very lightly in the BHI/sucrose. This strain has visible growth but very low OD values. Inhibition of growth with increasing polyol concentrations was observed but assessing the polyol inhibition break point was difficult with this strain. Conclusions: Xylitol and erythritol at sufficient concentrations were able to inhibit the growth of bacterial strains that have been associated with the development of Autism Spectrum Disorder in recently published studies.

At the ecological and evolutionary scales, the inevitable competition between the ingested probiotic and indigenous gut microbiome can lead to an increase in the instability. It remains largely unclear if and how exogenous prebiotic can improve the overall gut microbiome stability in probiotic consumption. In this study, we used Lactobacillus plantarum HNU082 (Lp082) as a model probiotic to examine the impact of the continuous or pulsed supplementation of galactooligosaccharide (GOS) on the gut microbiome stability in mice using shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Only continuous GOS supplement promoted the growth of probiotic and decreased its single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) mutation under competitive conditions. Besides, persistent GOS supplementation increased the overall stability, reshaped the probiotic competitive interactions with Bacteroides species in the indigenous microbiome, which was also evident by over-abundance of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) accordingly. Also, we identified a total of 793 SNPs arisen in probiotic administration in the indigenous microbiome. Over 90% of them derived from Bacteroides species, which involved genes encoding transposase, CAZymes, and membrane proteins. However, neither GOS supplementation here de-escalated the overall adaptive mutations within the indigenous microbes during probiotic intake. Collectively, our study demonstrated the beneficial effect of continuous prebiotic supplementation on the ecological and genetic stability of gut microbiomes. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

Kefir is a natural probiotic drink traditionally produced by milk fermentation using kefir grains. Kefir grains are composed of a complex population of bacteria and yeasts embedded in a polysaccharide-protein matrix. The geographic origin of kefir grains may largely influence their microbial composition and the associated kefir drink properties. Although the detailed bacterial composition of kefir grains form several geographic regions has been reported, to date, analogous data are lacking regarding the microbiome of Greek kefir. Hence, the aim of this study was to investigate the structure and the diversity of the bacterial community of Greek kefir grains. Experimental approach. The bacterial community structure and diversity of two different kefir grains from distant geographic regions in Greece were examined via high-throughput sequencing analysis, a culture-independent metagenomic approach, targeting the 16S rRNA V4 variable region, in order to gain a deeper understanding of their bacterial population diversities. Results and conclusions. Firmicutes (a phylum that includes lactic acid bacteria) was strikingly dominant amongst the bacterial phyla identified, with over 99 % of the sequences classified to this phylum for both kefir grains. At the family level, Lactobacillaceae sequences accounted for more than 98 % of the Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs), followed by Ruminococcaceae, Lahnospiraceae, Bacteroidaceae and other bacterial families of lesser abundance. Α relatively small number of bacterial genera dominated, with Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens being the most abundant in both kefir grains (95.0 % of OTUs in Kefir A and 96.3 % of OTUs in kefir B). However, a quite variable sub-dominant population was also present in both grains, including bacterial genera that have been previously associated with the gastrointestinal tract of humans and animals, some of which are believed to possess probiotic properties (Faecalibacterium spp., Bacteroides spp., Blautia spp.). Differences among the bacterial profiles of the two grains were very small indicating a high homogeneity despite the distant geographic origin. Novelty and scientific contribution. This is the first study to deeply explore and report on the bacterial diversity and species richness of Greek kefir. © 2020 University of Zagreb.",7.0

In this study, we evaluated the precise effects of B. longum on IBS via regulation of Paneth cell function. We confirmed the beneficial effects of B. longum on defecation habits and visceral hypersensitivity in WAS rats. Further analysis revealed that B. longum enhanced mucosal repair, promoted lysozyme production, and ameliorated dysbiosis of the microbiota in WAS rats. These processes are closely correlated with Paneth cell functions. In vitro, we incubated primary cultured enteroids with B. longum and found that B. longum promoted the proliferation of these organoids; this may be attributed to the upregulation of the stem niche factors WNT3A and TGF-β, which are secreted by Paneth cells. Based on our findings, we propose that B. longum relieves IBS by restoring the antimicrobial activity and stem niche maintenance function of Paneth cells. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

We studied the effect of Lactobacillus fermentum CECT5716 (Lc40) on growth and infection incidence of the infants, when the probiotic is administrated to the mothers. Moreover, whether such effects might depend on the interaction between the mother or infant microbiota and the probiotic administration. A total of 291 mother-infant pairs were studied for 16 weeks in a randomised double-blinded placebo-controlled multicentre trial. The Lc40 group (n=139) received 1 capsule/day containing 3×109cfu Lc40; the control group (n=152) received 1 placebo (maltodextrin) capsule/ day. A positive and significant correlation of the Staphylococcus load between breast milk and infant faeces was only observed in control group. Additionally, the weight z-score of the infants whose mothers had higher values of Lactobacillus in their breast milk were significantly higher for the Lc40 group. We observed a significant lower incidence of conjunctivitis in the infants whose mothers received Lc40. A higher load of Staphylococcus in infant faeces significantly increased the risk of respiratory infections. Such incidence, under an absent or low Staphylococcus load in the faeces, was significantly 36 times higher in the infants in the control group than in the infants in the Lc40 group. However, the protective effect of Lc40 was gradually reduced as the Staphylococcus load of the milk increased. The administration of Lc40 to nursing women might influence infant growth and health but it seems to depend on its interactions with mother or infant microbiota.

"Walker W.A., Meng D.",Breast Milk and Microbiota in the Premature Gut: A Method of Preventing Necrotizing Enterocolitis,2020,Nestle Nutrition Institute Workshop Series,10.1159/000505337,"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating inflammatory condition of the intestine, which affects premature infants and causes untold damage. Its pathogenesis has to do with how colonizing bacteria interact with the immature newborn intestine. An immature innate immune response with increased TLR-4 on the cell surface and increased signaling molecules, such as NF-κB, can cause excessive inflammation. This is in conjunction with a decrease in the appearance of regulatory molecules which effect the control of innate responses. This condition is so devastating that it must be prevented and not treated. Fortunately, breast milk and probiotics can affect the condition leading to reduced inflammation. How does this effect work? We have shown that breast milk tryptophan and Bifidobacterium infantis result in a metabolite (indole-3-lactic acid) response, which is anti-inflammatory via inhibition of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor transcription factor which stimulates an IL-8 response. We have also shown that breast milk complex carbohydrates interacting with Bacteroides fragilis can cause short-chain fatty acids which exert anti-inflammatory effects on the newborn intestine. These breast milk metabolites could help prevent NEC if shown to be effective clinically. © 2020 Nestlé Nutrition Institute, Switzerland/S. Karger AG, Basel.",4.0

The objective of this study was to determine the antagonistic effects of cell-free supernatants (CFS) derived from Clostridium butyricum against the growth and biofilm of ETBF. Our data showed that C. butyricum CFS inhibited the growth of B. fragilis in planktonic culture. In addition, C. butyricum CFS exhibited an antibiofilm effect by inhibiting biofilm development, disassembling preformed biofilms and reducing the metabolic activity of cells in biofilms. Using confocal laser scanning microscopy, we found that C. butyricum CFS significantly suppressed the proteins and extracellular nucleic acids among the basic biofilm components. Furthermore, C. butyricum CFS significantly downregulated the expression of virulence- and efflux pump-related genes including ompA and bmeB3 in B. fragilis.

Probiotics such as Lactobacillus are known to regulate gut microbes and prevent diseases. However, most of them are unable to colonize their stability in hosts' intestinal tracts. In this study, we investigated the ability of Lactobacillus casei SY13 (SY13) to colonize the intestinal tract of BALB/c mice, after its oral administration for a short-term (once for a day) and long-term (once daily for 27 days) duration. Furthermore, we also evaluated the influence of its administration on the gut microbial structure and diversity in mice. Male BALB/c mice were gavaged with 108 colony-forming units (CFU) of SY13, and TaqMan-MGB probe and Illumina MiSeq sequencing were performed to assess the colonization ability and bacterial community structure in the cecum contents. The results showed that long-term treatment with SY13 enhanced its ability to form a colony in the intestine tract in contrast to the short-term treatment group, whose colony was retained for only 3 days. Oral administration of SY13 also significantly enhanced the gut microbial diversity. Short-term treatment with SY13 (SSY13) elevated Firmicutes and diminished Bacteroidetes phyla compared with long-term treatment (LSY13) and controls.

However, connecting microbial community composition to ecosystem function remains a challenge. Here, we introduce MICOM, a customizable metabolic model of the human gut microbiome. By using a heuristic optimization approach based on L2 regularization, we were able to obtain a unique set of realistic growth rates that corresponded well with observed replication rates. We integrated adjustable dietary and taxon abundance constraints to generate personalized metabolic models for individual metagenomic samples. We applied MICOM to a balanced cohort of metagenomes from 186 people, including a metabolically healthy population and individuals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Model results showed that individual bacterial genera maintained conserved niche structures across humans, while the community-level production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) was heterogeneous and highly individual specific. Model output revealed complex cross-feeding interactions that would be difficult to measure in vivo. Metabolic interaction networks differed somewhat consistently between healthy and diabetic subjects. In particular, MICOM predicted reduced butyrate and propionate production in a diabetic cohort, with restoration of SCFA production profiles found in healthy subjects following metformin treatment. Overall, we found that changes in diet or taxon abundances have highly personalized effects. We believe MICOM can serve as a useful tool for generating mechanistic hypotheses for how diet and microbiome composition influence community function. All methods are implemented in an open-source Python package, which is available at https://github.com/micom-dev/micom. IMPORTANCE The bacterial communities that live within the human gut have been linked to health and disease. However, we are still just beginning to understand how those bacteria interact and what potential interventions to our gut microbiome can make us healthier. Here, we present a mathematical modeling framework (named MICOM) that can recapitulate the growth rates of diverse bacterial species in the gut and can simulate metabolic interactions within microbial communities. We show that MICOM can unravel the ecological rules that shape the microbial landscape in our gut and that a given dietary or probiotic intervention can have widely different effects in different people.

This study aimed to explore the therapeutic roles of probiotic mixtures of Bifidobacterium infantis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Enterococcus faecalis with (quadruple probiotics, P-qua) or without (triple probiotics, P-tri) aerobic Bacillus cereus in colitis, focusing on the multiple barrier functions. Materials and methods: Chronic colitis was induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in C57BL/6 mice. The probiotic mixtures P-qua or P-tri was gavage administrated respectively, while fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) as a positive control. The intestinal inflammation and functions of multiple barriers were assessed, including the mucus barrier, epithelial barrier and endothelial barrier known as gut-vascular barrier (GVB). Altered composition and diversity in gut microbiota were observed via sequencing analysis. Key findings: Both P-qua and P-tri relieved the intestinal inflammation and improved the functions of multiple barriers with increased integrity of mucous layer, enhanced transepithelial electrical resistance, declined epithelial and endothelial permeability to macromolecules in DSS-colitis. Aerobe-contained P-qua revealed a more active role in barrier recovering relative to P-tri, while FMT as a positive control seemed to get better results than pure probiotics. Indeed, P-qua was effective in rebuilding the structure and diversity of gut flora in DSS-colitis, especially increased abundance of Bifidobacterium, Akkermansia, Lactobacillus and Bacteroides.

In our study, we evaluated the effect of consortium of probiotics including five Lactobacilli strains and two Bifidobacterium strains on the colonization of toxigenic BI/NAP1/027 C. difficile in a mouse model. The results of 16S rRNA sequencing and targeted metabolomics showed the consortium of probiotics effectively decreased the colonization of C. difficile, changed the α- and β-diversity of the gut microbiota, decreased the primary bile acids, and increased the secondary bile acids. Spearman’s correlation showed that some of the OTUs such as Akkermansia, Bacteroides, Blautia et al. were positively correlated with C. difficile numbers and the primary bile acids, and negatively correlated with the secondary bile acids. However, some of the OTUs, such as Butyricicoccus, Ruminococcus, and Rikenellaceae, were negatively correlated with C. difficile copies and the primary bile acids, and positively correlated with the secondary bile acids.

Methods: Probiotics with lipid-lowering function were screened from the fecal microbiota of healthy adults. Polysaccharide from different sources was screened for improving insulin resistance. The combination of probiotics and Salvia miltiorrhiza polysaccharide (LBM) was investigated for alleviating hepatic steatosis. Results: First, Bifidobacterium bifidum V (BbV) and Lactobacillus plantarum X (LpX) were obtained from the fecal microbiota of healthy adults. Second, to improve insulin resistance, a Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge polysaccharide showing good performance in reducing insulin resistance was obtained. The liver total cholesterol (TC) and total triglyceride (TG) levels and the serum levels of free fatty acid, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, TG, and TC can be significantly reduced through supplementation with LpX-BbV (LB) in NAFLD mice. Interestingly, the function of the probiotic LB can be enhanced by S. miltiorrhiza Bunge polysaccharide. Furthermore, the gut microbiota was modulated by LpX-BbV+S. miltiorrhiza Bunge polysaccharide (LBM). The lipopolysaccharide concentration of the LBM group was decreased by 73.6% compared to the NAFLD group. Ultimately, the mRNA concentrations of the proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin 1β [IL-1β], and IL-6) decreased with LB and LBM treatment.

(2) Material and Methods: We designed this clinical trial using adaptive randomization by minimization. Selective culture media and Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time of Flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry techniques were used to identify the components of microbiota. The data obtained revealed a different variability of gut microbiota in stool samples of controls and SCA/P subjects.

We observed around 2-fold increase in flux compared to the baseline. Biosynthesis of 7-DHC was primarily modulated through acetate, pyruvate and lactate secreted by the bacterium. We observed diverse mechanisms and dose dependent responses. We extended this assessment to 119 resident bacteria and investigated the metabolites profiles with prebiotics supplementation. In summary, the current study suggests the potential use of applying prebiotics in enhancing 7-DHC biosynthesis. Furthermore, performance of the different gut bacteria with prebiotic supplementation for secreted metabolites profile is reported. These results may be useful to design future clinical studies. © 2019, The Author(s).",4.0

Gut microbiota and their metabolites short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), trimethylamine (TMA), and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) are involved in the development of hypertension. Despite the beneficial effects of prebiotic/probiotic on human health, little is known whether maternal use of prebiotics/probiotics could protect offspring against the development of hypertension in adulthood. We investigated whether perinatal HF diet-induced programmed hypertension in adult offspring can be prevented by therapeutic uses of prebiotic inulin or probiotic Lactobacillus casei during gestation and lactation. Pregnant Sprague–Dawley rats received regular chow or HF diet (D12331, Research Diets), with 5% w/w long chain inulin (PRE), or 2 × 108 CFU/day Lactobacillus casei via oral gavage (PRO) during pregnancy and lactation. Male offspring (n = 8/group) were assigned to four groups: control, HF, PRE, and PRO. Rats were sacrificed at 16 weeks of age. Maternal prebiotic or probiotic therapy prevents elevated blood pressure (BP) programmed by perinatal HF consumption. Both prebiotic and probiotic therapies decreased the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio and renal mRNA expression of Ace, but increased abundance of genus Lactobacillus and Akkermansia. Additionally, prebiotic treatment prevents HF-induced elevation of BP is associated with reduced fecal propionate and acetate levels, while probiotic therapy restored several Lactobacillus species. Maternal probiotic or prebiotic therapy caused a reduction in plasma TMAO level and TMAO-to-TMA ratio. The beneficial effects of prebiotic or probiotic therapy on elevated BP programmed by perinatal HF diet are relevant to alterations of microbial populations, modulation of microbial-derived metabolites, and mediation of the renin-angiotensin system. Our results cast a new light on the use of maternal prebiotic/probiotic therapy to prevent hypertension programmed by perinatal HF consumption. The possibility of applying gut microbiota-targeted therapies as a reprogramming strategy for hypertension warrants further clinical translation. © 2019 by the authors.

Probiotics are considered potential adjuvant therapies for liver disease. This study aimed to investigate the beneficial effects of Lactobacillus helveticus R0052 on acute liver injury and the underlying mechanisms. Sprague-Dawley rats were gavaged with L. helveticus R0052 suspensions (3 × 109 CFU) for 1 week. Subsequently, acute liver injury was induced by intraperitoneal d-galactosamine injection on the eighth day. After 24 h, samples (blood, liver, ileum, faeces) were collected and assessed for histological injury, inflammation, intestinal barrier, gut microbiome and metabolome. L. helveticus R0052 alleviated aminotransferase, bilirubin and total bile acid elevation and histological hepatic injuries. Additionally, L. helveticus R0052 exhibited anti-inflammatory properties by downregulating Toll-like receptors, tumour necrosis factor-α and nuclear factor-κb transcription in liver samples and decreasing proinflammatory cytokine plasma concentrations. Additionally, L. helveticus R0052 ameliorated intestinal abnormalities and regulated Toll-like receptors, claudin2 and mucin3 gene transcription in the intestine. These effects were associated with gut microbiome and metabolome modulation by L. helveticus R0052. Probiotic pretreatment enriched Lactobacillus and Bacteroides and depleted Flavonifractor and Acetatifactor in the gut microbiome. Meanwhile, L. helveticus R0052 improved carbohydrate and fatty acid metabolism and reduced lithocholic acid levels. These results indicate that L. helveticus R0052 is promising for alleviating acute liver injury and provide new insights regarding the correlations among the microbiome, the metabolome, the intestinal barrier and liver disease. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",16.0

To investigate the effects of aging on the gut microbiota independent of nutrient effects, we analyzed the gut microbiomes of 126 micro-pigs at a wide range of ages from newborns to 10 years old. The micro-pigs were reared in a constantly controlled environment. The diversity of the gut microbiome was found to continuously change with age. We also found associations between age and specific members and functions of the gut microbiome. Consistent with previous studies on the human gut microbiome, beneficial microbes including probiotic bacteria and short-chain fatty acid-producers decreased in older pigs, whereas Bacteroides increased with age. Based on the correlation network, Bacteroides seemed to have an important role in determining the relative abundances of other beneficial microbes. Our results suggest that maintaining beneficial gut microbes at a specific ratio corresponding to a certain age might contribute to a younger gut microbiome-age. Furthermore, due to similarities with the human system, micro-pigs are a useful animal model to elucidate the links between aging and the microbiome. © 2019, American Aging Association.",7.0

At the genus level, abundance levels of Desulfovibrionaceae sp., Oscillospira, and Bacteroides were high in mice fed the CT diet. At the operational taxonomic unit level, Bacteroides acidifaciens- and Bacteroides caecimuris-like bacteria were highly abundant in mice fed the CT diet. Faecalibaculum rodentium- and Allobaculum stercoricanis-like bacteria were highly abundant in the mice fed the Egg diet. These sets of taxa were assumed to be estimates of casein–tallow SIBs and egg SIBs, respectively, in the gut microbiome.

They are resistant to salivary amylase and gastric juice. In the present study the prebiotic potentials of different pectic derived substrates were performed by using intestinal cultures and measuring the growth, change in pH and short chain fatty acid, (SCFA) production. Arabinan, arabinogalactan, and rhamnogalacturonan were fermented by probiotic bacteria such as Bifidobacterium breve, Bi. longum, Bi. bifidum, and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (commensal bacteria). While, polygalacturonic acid was fermented by Ba. fragilis, Ba. thetaiotaomicron, and Ba. uniformis. All the screened bacteria significantly decreased the pH from 7 to 5 (pH difference of ≈ 2), which clearly indicated that the above bacteria produced the enzymes necessary for the digestion of the pectic derived polysaccharides. The SCFA profiles of the above screened bacteria clearly demonstrated the production of lactate, acetate and propionate which are the key metabolites involved in maintaining gut health and prevention of several intestinal diseases. Thus, pectic polysaccharides hold potential application in food industry as prebiotic ingredients or dietary fibers. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",17.0

However, the effect of NDRV infection on the composition of the host's intestinal microbiota remains poorly understood. In this study, three-day-old Muscovy ducklings were inoculated with either the virulent NDRV strain NP03 or sterile Hank's solution. Through Illumina MiSeq sequencing, the whole cecal microbiota of healthy and NDRV infected ducklings was examined. The results showed that the gut microbiota was mainly dominated by Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Bacteroidestes in both healthy and NDRV infected ducks. NDRV infection altered the relative abundance of bacteria. Specifically, families Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae were remarkably reduced, whereas Escherichia_Shigella belonging to family Enterobacteriaceae was significantly increased. Collectively, NDRV infection in Muscovy ducks resulted in a shift of the gut microbiota, including a net loss of probiotic bacteria with a compensatory expansion of pathogenic bacteria.

PR39 could effectively inhibit the growth of Gram-negative bacteria, but there is little knowledge of its effects on intestinal barrier function and the microbiota in E. coli-challenged mice. In this study, an intestinal disease caused by EHEC O157:H7 was established, to analyze the effect of PR39 on EHEC O157:H7 induced intestinal epithelial barrier injury and disorder. Interestingly, PR39 attenuated EHEC O157:H7-induced systemic symptoms and significantly decreased mortality and the degree of E. coli shedding in faeces. Furthermore, the infiltration index of macrophages and neutrophils in intestine of the PR39 treatment group were obviously attenuated, along with the level of apoptosis. PR39 treatment group had distinctly improved tight junction associated proteins’ expression after EHEC O157:H7 caused injury. Additionally, the sequencing analysis of cecum microbiota showed that PR39 altered the abnormal increase in Bacteroides caused by EHEC O157:H7 and promoted the growth of probiotics such as Lactobacillus. In conclusion, cathelicidin-derived PR39 could effectively improve EHEC O157:H7-induced epithelial barrier injury, and dysfunction of immune and microbiota homeostasis in the intestinal tract, indicating that PR39 could be an excellent potential drug for zoonotic EHEC O157:H7-related intestinal disease. © 2019, The Author(s).",6.0

Foodborne diseases can lead to high morbidity and mortality and result in huge economic losses. Some foodborne diseases are associated with antibiotic resistance, which is a significant problem throughout the world. To reduce the harm caused by antibiotics, it is important to find alternatives so that food is not infected with foodborne pathogens. Anthocyanins and catechins, two species of plant polyphenols with strong antioxidant properties, offer a promising new approach to preventing foodborne disease. Recent studies have shown that these compounds are good growth inhibitors. In this review, we focus on the antibacterial properties of anthocyanins and catechins as antibiotic substitutes. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of anthocyanins against E. coli and Salmonella is 10–400 mg/ml. The MIC of catechins against E. coli and Salmonella is 6–50 mg/ml. Anthocyanins and catechins can also significantly reduce the abundance of pathogenic bacteria that produce toxins in the host including Desulfovibrio sp. and Enterococcus. At the same time, we summarize the antibacterial mechanism of Anthocyanins and catechins on Salmonella and Escherichia coli. Anthocyanins and catechins can increase the abundance of probiotics such as Akkermansia, Bifidobacteria, and increase the ratio of thick-walled bacteria to Bacteroides. Finally, it seems that Anthocyanins and catechins can regulate the composition of intestinal microbes to improve intestinal immunity and promote intestinal health, thereby controlling foodborne. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",55.0

We performed a comparative study of the GM profile of 19 AD children and 18 healthy individuals aimed at identifying bacterial biomarkers associated with the disease. The effect of probiotic intake (Bifidobacterium breve plus Lactobacillus salivarius) on the modulation of GM and the probiotic persistence in the GM were also evaluated. Faecal samples were analysed by real-time PCR and 16S rRNA targeted metagenomics. Although the probiotics, chosen for this study, did not shape the entire GM profile, we observed the ability of these species to pass through the gastrointestinal tract and to persist (only B. breve) in the GM. Moreover, the GM of patients compared to CTRLs showed a dysbiotic status characterised by an increase of Faecalibacterium, Oscillospira, Bacteroides, Parabacteroides and Sutterella and a reduction of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria (i.e., Bifidobacterium, Blautia, Coprococcus, Eubacterium and Propionibacterium).

However, it is unclear whether and what extend Baimang disease alters the intestinal microbiota in mud crab (Scylla paramamosain). Here, we conducted intestinal contents Illumina sequencing of healthy and Baimang diseased mud crab (S. paramamosain) to understand bacterial community variations among health status. In addition, bacterial functional predication was used to investigate whether and how the bacteria variations further change their functions? The phyla of Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Tenericutes, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Spirochaetae constituted over 96.44% of the total intestinal bacteria, with being the dominant taxa. The 7 most significantly different orders, including the increased four orders of Clostridiales, Entomoplasmatales, Bacteroidales, and Mycoplasmatales and the decreased three orders of Vibrionales, Campylobacterales, and Fusobacteriales, accounted for 61.14% dissimilarity, probably being the indicator taxa of Baimang disease. Accordingly, 12 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes orthologies in level 3 shifted significantly at the diseased crabs. Especially, bacterial secretion system, secretion system, lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis proteins and Vibrio cholerae pathogenic cycle, being related to bacterial virulence, were reduced. In addition, the reduced butanoate metabolism, and induced methane metabolism and one carbon pool by folate were important metabolic processes of probiotic, such as Bacteroides spp. and Clostridium spp., with playing critical roles in host health.

It accounts for approximately 1.34 million deaths annually in children younger than five years. Infection can be caused by viral, bacterial and/or parasitic microorganisms. Dysbiosis due to such infections could dramatically affect disease prognosis as well as development of chronic illness. The aim of this study was to analyze gut microbiome and clinical outcomes in young children suffering from viral or mixed viral-bacterial infection. We evaluated gut microbiota composition in children suffering from viral or mixed viral-bacterial infection with two major viruses rotavirus (RV) and norovirus (NoV) and two pathogenic bacteria [Enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC), and Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC)]. We sequenced 16S ribosomal RNA (V4 region) genes using Illumina MiSeq in 70 hospitalized children suffering from gastroenteric infections plus nine healthy controls. The study summarized Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) abundances with the Bray-Curtis index and performed a non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis to visualize microbiome similarities. We used a permutational multivariate analyses of variance to test the significance of group differences. We also analyzed the correlation between microbiome changes and clinical outcomes. Our data demonstrated a significant increase in the severity score in children with viral-bacterial mixed infections compared to those with virus infections alone. Statistical analysis by overall relative abundance denoted lesser proportions of Bacteroides in the infected children, whereas Bifidobacteriaceae richness was more prominent in the bacterial-viral mixed infections. Pairwise differences of gut microbiota were significantly higher in RV + EAEC (P = 0.009) and NoV + EAEC (P = 0.009) co-infections, compared to EPEC mixed infection with both, RV (P = 0.045) and NoV (P = 0.188). Shannon diversity index showed considerable more variation in microbiome diversity in children infected with RV cohort compared to NoV cohort. Our results highlight that richness of Bifidobacteriaceae, which acts as probiotics, increased with the severity of the viral-bacterial mixed infections. As expected, significant reduction of relative numbers of Bacteroides was characterized in both RV and NoV infections, with more reduction observed in co-infection pathogenic E. coli. Although mixed infection with EAEC resulted in significant microbiota differences compared to viral infection only or mixed infection with EPEC, the clinical condition of the children were worsened with both pathogenic E.coli co-infections. Further, in comparison with RV cohort, augmented number of differential abundant pathogenic OTUs were peculiarly noticed only with NoV mixed infection. © 2019, The Author(s).",23.0

This study investigated the effects of Clostridium butyricum (CB) on the growth performance, intestinal immune, and gut microbiota of weaning rex rabbits. A total of 60 healthy female rabbits (5-month-old) were divided equally into four groups and mated on the same day: control group (CTRL, fed with basal feed), low-dose group (LDG, fed with basal feed + 1.0 × 103 CFU/g CB), middle-dose group (MDG, fed with basal feed + 1.0 × 104 CFU/g CB), and high-dose group (HDG, fed with basal feed + 1.0 × 105 CFU/g CB). Then, 30 weaning rex rabbits (35-day-old) were collected from each group for this experiment, and they were offered the same feeds as their mother. The results demonstrated that high-dose CB treatment significantly increased average daily weight gain of weaning rex rabbits. Further studies suggested that CB enhanced small intestinal digestive enzyme activity and improved mucosal morphology and antioxidant status. Supplemented with CB, small intestinal barrier function was maintained with the upregulation of mRNA levels of ZO-1, claudin, and occludin as well as the increase of sIgA production. Moreover, the relative expressions of MyD88, TLR2, and TLR4 were elevated in HDG; simultaneously, pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-6, INF-γ, and TNF-α were decreased after CB administration. In addition, CB showed beneficial effects in improving weaning rex rabbit intestinal microflora via increasing the abundance of beneficial bacteria. Therefore, our results indicated CB can promote rex rabbit growth, which is likely to the enhancement of immune function and the improvement of intestinal microbiota. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",29.0

Probiotics can reconstitute the host intestinal microbiota and strengthen gastrointestinal function, however, clinical data proving the effect of probiotics treatment on ASD is lacking. Methods: This study explored the significant differences between ASD and neurotypical (NT), and the improvement of applied behavior analysis (ABA) training in combination with probiotics, vs. ABA training only. Results: We found significant differences between the ASD group and the NT group in the evenness of the intestinal microbiota and the relative abundance of the bacterial phyla and genus. At the phylum level, relative abundance of Bacteroidetes in the ASD group was significantly lower than in the NT group. At the genus level, the relative abundance of Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Ruminococcus, Roseburia, and Blautia in the ASD group was significantly lower than that in the NT group. After a 4-week ABA training program in combination with probiotics treatment, the ATEC and GI scores decreased more than the control group with ABA training only. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that intestinal microbiota is different between the NT children and the ASD children with or without GI problems. In combination with ABA training, probiotics treatment can bring more benefit to ASD children. Clinical trials with a more rigorous design and larger sample size are indispensable for further validation. © Copyright © 2019 Niu, Li, Zhang, Wen, Dang, Duan, Li, Ruan, Yang, Guan, Tian, Gao, Zhang, Yuan and Han.",23.0

Methods This study took the mucosal microecology as the entry point and an antibiotic mixture was used to induce diarrhea in mice. D. hansenii suspension was used to treat the mice and the bacterial communities of mucosa was analyzed using high-throughput sequencing. Results The Shannon-Wiener index indicated that the sequencing depth is reasonable and reflected the majority of microbial information. The principal coordinate analysis results showed that mice in the treatment group and the normal group had a similar microbial community structure, while differences in microbial community structure were observed between the model group and the treatment group. The inter-group bacterial structures were analyzed at the phylum level and genus level. The results revealed that antibiotic treatment increased the proportion of Proteobacteria and decreased the proportion of Bacteroides, while D. hansenii treatment inhibited the increase in Proteobacteria. Linear discriminant analysis coupled with effect size measurements (LEfSe) suggested d that the beneficial bacteria Candidatus Arthromitus were the only common bacteria in the normal group (P<0.05). Conclusion The treatment with D.hansenii could contribute to the maintenance of the structure of the mucosal microbiota in comparison with the normal group and inhibit the proliferation of opportunistic bacteria.

In this study, a strain of Lactobacillus plantarum was isolated and identified from yak yogurt in Hongyuan, Sichuan Province and named Lactobacillus plantarum HFY05 (LP-HFY05). LP-HFY05 was compared with a common commercial strain of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (LDSB). LP-HFY05 showed better anti-artificial gastric acid and bile salt effects than LDSB in in vitro experiments, indicating its potential as a probiotic. In animal experiments, long-term alcohol gavage induced alcoholic liver injury. LP-HFY05 effectively reduced the liver index of mice with liver injury, downregulated the levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, triglyceride, total cholesterol, blood urea nitrogen, nitric oxide, and MDA and upregulated the levels of albumin, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase in the serum of liver-injured mice. LP-HFY05 also reduced the levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-12, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interferon-gamma in the serum of liver-injured mice. The pathological observations showed that LP-HFY05 reduced the damage to liver cells caused by alcohol. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot assays further showed that LP-HFY05 upregulated neuronal nitric oxide synthase, endothelial nitric oxide synthase, manganese-SOD, cuprozinc-SOD, CAT, and inhibitor of κB-α mRNA and protein expression and downregulated the expression of nuclear factor-κB-p65 and inducible nitric oxide synthase in the livers of liver-injured mice. A fecal analysis revealed that LP-HFY05 regulated the microbial content in the intestinal tract of mice with liver injury, increased the content of beneficial bacteria, including Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, and Lactobacillus and reduced the content of harmful bacteria, including Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Enterobacteriaceae, thus, regulating intestinal microorganisms to protect against liver injury. The effect of LP-HFY05 on liver-injured mice was better than that of LDSB, and the effect was similar to that of silymarin. LP-HFY05 is a high-quality microbial strain with a liver protective effect on experimental mice with alcoholic liver injury. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",15.0

The IBD mucosa produced higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines referred to healthy controls (HCs). Peptides B7 and B12, however, did not ameliorate the mucosal cytokine milieu in IBD. Human circulating APCs (B-cells, monocytes, plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), and conventional dendritic cells (cDCs)) were characterized by flow cytometry in presence/absence of the peptides. Circulating B-cells, monocytes, and cDCs from IBD patients were more activated than those from HCs. Peptide B7, but not B12, decreased CCR2 expression on all APC subsets from HC, but not IBD patients. Moreover, both peptides tend to further increase their pro-inflammatory profile in IBD. In summary, IBD patients display mucosal and circulating APC pro-inflammatory properties. Peptide B7 immunomodulatory capacity elicited over circulating APCs from HC, but not IBD patients, suggests the presence of disrupted modulatory mechanisms for this peptide in IBD. Future studies should address the effect of bacteria-derived immunomodulatory peptides in non-inflamed (quiescent) IBD patients. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",10.0

The chemical properties and probiotic effects of FBTPS-3 were evaluated by fermentation in vitro. Moreover, the effects of FBTPS-3 on the function and metabolic pathway of gut microbiota were investigated by metagenomic sequencing. The results showed that FBTPS-3 was an heteropolysaccharide with molecular weight of 741 kDa, which was mainly composed of Man, Rha, GalA, Gal and Ara in molar ratio of 8.7:15.5:42.2:19.7:13.9. The contents of carbohydrates and uronic acid in FBTPS-3 were 44.78 ± 2.85% and 40.4 ± 2.11%, respectively. After fermentation, the molecular weight of FBTPS-3 and content of carbohydrates were significantly decreased, indicating that FBTPS-3 could be utilized by gut microbiota. Furthermore, the relative abundances of Bacteroides, Megasphaera and Prevotella were significantly increased by FBTPS-3. FBTPS-3 also significantly promoted the production of acetic, propionic and n-butyric acids. Based on the metagenomic sequencing, it was found that FBTPS-3 significantly enriched the metabolic pathway of starch and sucrose. All the results suggest that FBTPS-3 is expected to be developed as functional ingredients or foods to improve the host health through regulating the gut microbiota and physiological metabolic functions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",31.0

C. Ma. The monosaccharide composition analysis indicated that CDA-0.05 was composed of glucose and galactose in a molar ratio of 96.4: 3.6. The backbone of CDA-0.05 contained 1, 4-linked α-D-Glcp, 1, 4, 6-linked α-D-Glcp and 1, 4-linked β-D-Galp, with branches of T-linked α-D-Glcp attached at C-6 of 1, 4, 6-linked α-D-Glcp residues. Bioactivity test results suggested that CDA-0.05 could promote the growth of three species of Bacteroides (B. thetaiotaomicron, B. ovatus and B. fragilis) significantly. Furthermore, CDA-0.05 could also promote some probiotics growth, such as Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus reuteri. These results suggested that CDA-0.05 might help to maintain intestinal homeostasis and could be recommended as part of fibers or drugs candidate to benefit human body by regulating gut bacteria. © 2019",12.0

CTX-M-15-positive, ESBL-producing E. coli and carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae, Bacteroides fragilis, Bifidobacterium longum, Clostridium butyricum, Clostridioides difficile, Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus plantarum and probiotic strain of C. butyricum MIYAIRI 588 were used in this study. The growth of AMR organisms was suppressed by the supernatant of C. butyricum, C. difficile, C. perfringens, E. faecium and L. plantarum in a dose dependent manner but not by that of B. fragilis and B. longum. The β-lactamase activity produced by E. coli was reduced by the presence of culture supernatant of certain gut microbiota during stationary phase of E. coli. Importantly, C. butyricum MIYAIRI 588 culture supernatant suppressed the transcription of blaCTX-M gene during growth phase of E. coli.

Aims and Objectives: The purpose of the study is to look at the benefit of administration of an oral prebiotic amylase resistant starch in reducing the incidence of acute radiation proctitis, a distressing symptom in patients receiving radiation therapy for cancer of the cervix. Material and Methods: The study was conducted between 2011 and 2014 in 104 patients receiving radical chemo-radiotherapy for carcinoma cervix. Patients were randomized in to two arms, one receiving 30 gm of resistant starch and the other digestible starch on a daily basis throughout the course of the external radiotherapy. All patients received standard 4-field box radiation portals, 50 Gy in 25 fractions with 4 cycles of weekly concurrent Cisplatin. At completion of external beam radiotherapy, all patients underwent LDR/HDR brachytherapy. The study was double blinded and allocation was concealed from the investigators. The investigator recorded the radiotherapy related toxicity of the patients according to CTC V 3.0. The incidence and severity of grade 2-4 diarrhoea and proctitis were documented on a weekly basis and compared across the two groups and analyzed. Stool short chain fatty acid concentrations were measured at baseline at 2nd and 4th week and after 6 weeks of completion of radiotherapy in both study placebo arms and reported. The pattern of microbiota in the stool were also estimated in all patients at 4 time points. Two patients who progressed during therapy were not included in the analyses and two patients discontinued the intervention. A per protocol analyses was done. Results: At analysis there were 50 patients in each arm. The severity of clinical proctitis was found to be similar in both groups of patients with 12.2 % of patients experiencing toxicity of grade 2 and above in digestible starch group versus 14.6% in the resistant starch group. Functional proctitis was similarly graded and it was found that 16.3 % patients in digestible starch group experienced toxicity against 10.2 % patients in the resistant starch group. This difference was seen at 4th week and continued in the subsequent weeks till the end of radiation. Both groups had similar reported toxicity at 6 weeks post intervention and similar incidence of grade 2 and above diarrhea. The resistant starch group was found to have 8% incidence as compared to 2% in the other group at the 5th and 6th week. The short chain fatty acid concentrations were not significantly different in the groups at any point. Conclusion: The study did not demonstrate a significant benefit in administering resistant starch over and above normal diet to patients receiving pelvic radiotherapy. The reasons may be attributed to concurrent use of chemotherapy and decrease in intestinal probiotics. The use of digestible starch in the control arm may have contributed to lower incidence of the toxicity endpoints as well. © 2019 Journal of Cancer Research and Therapeutics - Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.",8.0

The findings might offer diagnostic biomarkers before the onset of dementia. Background: AD is the most common cause of dementia, and MCI is the predementia state. Recent studies suggest the alterations in the gut microbial communities associated with AD, whereas the microbiota in MCI before the onset of dementia has not been discovered and characterized in humans. New/Updated Hypothesis: We hypothesize that the dysbiosis happens in the MCI stage. Patients with AD and MCI have decreased microbial diversity, and changes in gut microbiota could be detected for early detection of AD. In our preliminary study, we identified differences between AD and normal controls in 11 genera from the feces and 11 genera from the blood. No difference in genera between AD and MCI was detected. Using the diagnostic model from fecal samples with all different genera input, 93% (28 in 30) of patients with MCI could be identified correctly. Major Challenges for the Hypothesis: The diagnosis of MCI and AD in the study was based on symptoms and neuroimaging, and AD biomarkers should be included for precise diagnosis in further validating studies. Besides, as the microbiota changes longitudinally, their relationship with the progress of dementia needs to be studied in the prospective studies. Linkage to Other Major Theories: Escherichia was observed increased at genus level in both fecal and blood samples from AD and MCI. For AD biomarker, postmortem brain tissue from patients with AD showed lipopolysaccharides and gram-negative Escherichia coli fragments colocalize with amyloid plaque. In this way, the amyloid pathogenesis for AD would be triggered during MCI by gut microbiota shifting. Besides, systemic inflammatory reactions caused by compounds secreted by bacteria may impair the blood-brain barrier and promote neuroinflammation and/or neurodegeneration. Furthermore, abnormal metabolites caused by microbial gene functions have an impact on neurodegeneration. © 2019 the Alzheimer's Association",96.0

BF is also the most commonly isolated organism from clinical cases of intra-abdominal abscesses, suggesting its potential to induce proinflammatory responses upon accessing the systemic compartment. Hence, we examined the impact of mucosal and systemic exposures to BF on type 1 diabetes (T1D) incidence in NOD mice. The impact of intestinal exposure to BF under a chemically induced enhanced gut permeability condition, which permits microbial translocation, in T1D was also examined. While oral administration of heat-killed (HK) BF to prediabetic mice caused enhanced immune regulation and suppression of autoimmunity, resulting in delayed hyperglycemia, mice that received HK BF by intravenous injection showed rapid disease progression. Importantly, polysaccharide A-deficient BF failed to produce these opposing effects upon oral and systemic deliveries. Furthermore, BF-induced modulation of disease progression was observed in wild-type, but not TLR2-deficient, NOD mice. Interestingly, oral administration of BF under enhanced gut permeability conditions resulted in accelerated disease progression and rapid onset of hyperglycemia in NOD mice. Overall, these observations suggest that BF-like gut commensals can cause proinflammatory responses upon gaining access to the systemic compartment and contribute to T1D in at-risk subjects. © 2019 by the American Diabetes Association.",11.0

A total of 225 healthy olive flounders (initial mean body weight, 13.5 ± 0.01 g) were randomly separated into 3 groups of 75 fish, each group having three replicates of 25 fish; first group was fed with a FM-based control diet (Con), 2nd group was fed with a low-FM diet containing a blend of plant and animal protein meals replacing 30% of the FM protein (FM30), and 3rd group was fed with the FM30 diet supplemented with 108–109 CFU kg−1 of the MSP (Pro). With the exception of lipid retention, which was significantly lower in fish fed the FM30 diet compared to the other two treatments, no other statistically significant differences were recorded with respect to any of the other growth and nutrient utilization parameters. Myeloperoxidase and lysozyme activities of fish fed the Pro diet were much higher and significantly different than those of fish fed the FM30 diet. Glutathione peroxidase activity was significantly higher in Pro- than in Con-fed fish, which, in turn, was significantly higher than FM30-fed fish. Expression of immune-related genes including IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α was markedly upregulated in livers of the fish fed Pro diet compared to those fed the Con and FM30 diets. Furthermore, supplementation of MSP in FM30 diet enriched the Lactobacillus abundance in the fish gut as well as predictive gene functions in relation to lipid and carbohydrate metabolisms. These data suggested that the MSP could reduce the potential adverse effects of the low-FM diet and might be used as a healthy immunostimulant for olive flounder. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",20.0

We have recently shown that conventional mice are protected from Campylobacter jejuni infection, which was not the case for human microbiota associated (hma) mice indicating that the host-specific gut microbiota composition primarily determines susceptibility to or resistance against C. jejuni infection. In our present preclinical intervention study we addressed whether gut microbiota changes in stably C. jejuni infected hma mice following murine fecal microbiota transplantation (mFMT) could alleviate pathogen-induced immune responses. To accomplish this, secondary abiotic C57BL/6 mice were generated by broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment, perorally reassociated with a complex human gut microbiota and challenged with C. jejuni by gavage. Seven days later C. jejuni infected hma mice were subjected to peroral mFMT on 3 consecutive days. Within a week post-mFMT fecal pathogenic burdens had decreased by two orders of magnitude, whereas distinct changes in the gut microbiota composition with elevated numbers of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria could be assessed. In addition, mFMT resulted in less C. jejuni induced apoptotic responses in colonic epithelia, reduced numbers of macrophages and monocytes as well as of T lymphocytes in the large intestinal mucosa and lamina propria and in less distinct intestinal pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion as compared to mock challenge. Strikingly, inflammation dampening effects of mFMT were not restricted to the intestinal tract, but could also be observed systemically as indicated by elevated serum concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-12p70, and IL-6 in C. jejuni infected hma mice of the mock, but not the mFMT cohort. In conclusion, our preclinical mFMT intervention study provides evidence that changes in the gut microbiota composition which might be achieved by pre- or probiotic formulations may effectively lower intestinal C. jejuni loads, dampen both, pathogen-induced intestinal and systemic inflammatory sequelae and may represent a useful tool to treat continuous shedding of C. jejuni by asymptomatic carriers which is critical in the context of food production, hospitalization and immunosuppression. © Copyright © 2019 Heimesaat, Mrazek and Bereswill.",9.0

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) accounts for more than 90% of diabetic patients, mainly caused by environmental factors. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) exhibit several health benefits to the host including regulating glucose and lipid metabolism and improving oxidative stress and inflammatory response. However, the anti-diabetic mechanism of probiotics has not been elucidated clearly. In this study, the anti-diabetic effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus KLDS1.1003 and KLDS1.0901 on T2D mice were assessed. Oral administration of L. acidophilus KLDS1.1003 and KLDS1.0901 for 6 weeks significantly improved the epithelial barrier function, which in turn lowered inflammation cytokines, including IL-8, TNF-α and IL-1β in liver and colon tissue, and prevented liver and colon tissue injuries to some extent. Additionally, L. acidophilus treatment regulated the expression genes that are related to glucose and lipid metabolism. The two tested strains down-regulated the expression of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β), fatty acid synthase (FAS) and sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1c (SREBP-1c), and up-regulated the expression of protein kinase B (Akt). However, L. acidophilus KLDS1.0901 is better for improving T2D than L. acidophilus KLDS1.1003. Further research showed that L. acidophilus KLDS1.0901 supplementation could reshape gut microbiota, increasing short chain fatty acid-producing bacteria (Blautia, Roseburia and Anaerotruncus) and the level of SCFAs and decreasing the relative abundance of Gram-negative bacteria such as Desulfovibrio, Alistipes and Bacteroides. Notably, L. acidophilus KLDS1.0901 treatment restored the structure of gut microbiota similar to the control group. These findings suggested that L. acidophilus KLDS1.0901 might be used as a new type of antidiabetic drug candidate. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",50.0

Based on this compelling body of evidence, there is growing enthusiasm for research focused on translating this emerging association into novel therapies for psychiatric illnesses. The links between gut microbiota disturbances and brain dysfunction have clearly been demonstrated in rodents. Researchers have proven that gut microbiota plays a major role in the central nervous system development, and that germ-free mice (mice born by c-section and without microbiota) do develop severe behavioral disorders mimicking MD with social withdrawal, self-neglect, eating and sleep disorders, anxiety, as well as hopelessness. A recent study has demonstrated that this major depression phenotype could be transferable from one mouse to another through microbiota transplantation. Moreover, microbiota dysfunctions have been associated with peripheral immune inflammation as well as neuro-inflammation (also called microglia activation). Subjects with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) display higher rates of comorbid MD. The gut microbiota of patients with Major Depression (MD) to be similar to that of patients with IBS-diarrhea subtype (IBS-D) in that sense that their gut microbiota was less diverse than that from healthy control samples, with similar abundances of alterations (high proportions of Bacteroides and Prevotella). IBS is currently considered to be the paradigmatic microbiota-related disorder. Another study found the MD groups exhibited increased levels of Enterobacteriaceae and Alistipes (nocive bacteria), though reduced levels of Faecalibacterium (healthy bacteria). In this study, a negative correlation was likewise observed between Faecalibacterium and severity of depressive symptoms. Alpha gut microbiota diversity within samples was associated with depressive severity in two studies. Another study found altered microbiota signatures in the gut microbiota of MD patients, including Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria phyla and, more specifically, 16 bacterial families. Probiotics are microorganisms that, when consumed, contribute to the host gut microbial flora, thereby producing beneficial effects on health. Among several possibilities for MD treatment that have garnered substantial interest in recent times, probiotics hold particular appeal. The effectiveness of probiotic administration in MD constitutes a strong evidence for developing microbiota-orientated treatments in this indication. Probiotics have yielded medium-to-large significant effects in the setting of depression (d = −.73 [95% CI = −1.02; −.44]). Whereas the first study evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of prebiotics or probiotics on depression or anxiety was conducted over a decade ago, approximately half of all existing studies were published over the past two years, reflecting the rapidly growing interest in this area.

However, little is known about the microbiota of children who cannot eat by mouth. Standard enteral formulas for supplemental nutrition are low in fiber and high in processed sugars and are commonly associated with gastrointestinal side effects. In this pilot study, we examined the effects of plant-based enteral nutrition (PBEN) upon the gut bacteria of chronically ill children. Methods: Ten children (median age 3.5 years, age range 2–8 years) dependent upon conventional enteral formula were transitioned to PBEN for 2 months. Microbial diversity within fecal samples collected before and after PBEN was assessed by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequence analysis and was compared with rectal swabs from healthy children. Fecal short-chain fatty acids and bile acids were measured in parallel. Results: Relative to control samples, fecal samples from study subjects were depleted of commensals (eg, Faecalibacterium) and enriched with pathogens (eg, Enterococcus). Postintervention samples from study subjects were more similar to healthy controls. Most subjects experienced PBEN-induced alterations in the gut microbiota, but these changes varied significantly across individuals. Clinical diaries indicated that PBEN was well tolerated, with improvement in symptoms noted in several subjects. Conclusion: Results from this pilot study suggest that PBEN is well tolerated and could improve the health of the microbiota in chronically ill children.

Under these circumstances, regulation of enteric flora may be beneficial to the repair of inflammation. We aimed to investigate the effects of probiotics (Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus), prebiotics and their combination on inflammation, and microflora in mice of acute colitis.MethodsC57BL/6J mice were divided into six groups randomly (blank control group, model control group, probiotics group, synbiotics group, lactitol group and probiotics + lactitol group). Each group was given 2.5% dextran sulfate sodium drinking water for 5 days other than the blank control group. Except for the model control group, the other four groups were intervened with probiotics, synbiotics (probiotics and inulin), lactitol, and probiotics + lactitol. Mice were sacrificed after 1 week of gavage, and pathologic scores were calculated. The feces of different periods and intestinal mucosa samples were collected to analyze the differences of intestinal microbiota by 16S rRNA sequencing. Differences of two groups or multiple groups were statistically examined through unpaired Student t test and analysis of variance (ANOVA), respectively. ANOVA, Tukey, Anosim, and metastats analysis were used to compare differences of microbiota among different groups.ResultsAfter gavage for 1 week, the pathologic scores of groups with the intervention were significantly lower than those in the model control group, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). The model control group was higher in the genus of Bacteroides (relative abundance: 0.3679 vs. 0.0099, P = 0.0016) and lower in Lactobacillus (relative abundance: 0.0020 vs. 0.0122, P = 0.0188), Roseburia (relative abundance: 0.0004 vs. 0.0109, P = 0.0157), compared with the blank control group. However, the same phenomenon was not found in groups gavaged with probiotics and lactitol. Compared with model control group, mice with intervention were increased with Bifidobacterium (relative abundance: 0.0172 vs. 0.0039, P = 0.0139), Lachnospiraceae-NK4A136-group (relative abundance: 0.1139 vs. 0.0320, P = 0.0344), Lachnospiraceae-UCG-006 (relative abundance: 0.0432 vs. 0.0054, P = 0.0454), and decreased with Alistipes (relative abundance: 0.0036 vs. 0.0105, P = 0.0207) in varying degrees. The mucosal flora was more abundant than the fecal flora, and genus of Mucispirillum (relative abundance: 0.0207 vs. 0.0001, P = 0.0034) was more common in the mucosa. Lactitol group showed higher level of Akkermansia than model control group (relative abundance: 0.0138 vs. 0.0055, P = 0.0415), probiotics group (relative abundance: 0.0138 vs. 0.0022, P = 0.0041), and synbiotics group (relative abundance: 0.0138 vs. 0.0011, P = 0.0034), while probiotics + lactitol group had more abundant Akkermansia than synbiotics group (relative abundance: 0.0215 vs. 0.0013, P = 0.0315).ConclusionsProbiotics and prebiotics reduce the degree of inflammation in acute colitis mice obviously. Mice with acute colitis show reduced beneficial genera and increased harmful genera. Supplementation of probiotics and prebiotics display the advantage of increasing the proportion of helpful bacteria and regulating the balance of intestinal microbiota.

Probiotics have been shown to exert beneficial health-promoting effects through modulation of intestinal microflora biodiversity, thus the effects of probiotics administration on D-galactose (D-gal) senescence-induced rat were evaluated based on the changes in gut microbiota and metabolomic profiles. Upon senescence induction, the ratio of Firmicutes/ Bacteroidetes was significantly lowered, while treatment with Lactobacillus helveticus OFS 1515 and L. fermentum DR9 increased the ratio at the phylum level (P < 0.05). Study on the genus level showed that L. paracasei OFS 0291 and L. helveticus OFS 1515 administration reduced Bacteroides, which are prominently opportunistic pathogens while L. fermentum DR9 treated rats promoted the proliferation of Lactobacillus compared to the aged rats (P < 0.05). Probiotics treatment did not alter fecal short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) profile, but an increase in acetate was observed in the D-gal rats. The analysis of fecal water-soluble metabolites showed that D-gal induced senescence caused great impact on amino acids metabolism such as urocanic acid, citrulline, cystamine and 5-oxoproline, which could serve as potential aging biomarkers. Treatment with probiotics ameliorated these metabolites in a strain-specific manner, whereby L. fermentum DR9 promoted antioxidative effect through upregulation of oxoproline, whereas both L. paracasei OFS 0291 and L. helveticus OFS 1515 restored the levels of reducing sugars, arabinose and ribose similar to the young rats. D-gal induced senescence did cause significant immunological alteration in the colon of aged rats however, all probiotic strains demonstrated immunomodulatory properties as L. paracasei OFS 0291, L. helveticus OFS 1515 and L. fermentum DR9 alleviated proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IFN-γ and IL-1β as well as IL-4 compared to the aged control (P < 0.05).

This study focuses on the effect of melatonin on intestinal mucosal injury and microbiota dysbiosis in sleep-deprived mice. Mice subjected to SD had significantly elevated norepinephrine levels and decreased melatonin content in plasma. Consistent with the decrease in melatonin levels, we observed a decrease of antioxidant ability, down-regulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines and up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines in sleep-deprived mice, which resulted in colonic mucosal injury, including a reduced number of goblet cells, proliferating cell nuclear antigen-positive cells, expression of MUC2 and tight junction proteins and elevated expression of ATG5, Beclin1, p-P65 and p-IκB. High-throughput pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA demonstrated that the diversity and richness of the colonic microbiota were decreased in sleep-deprived mice, especially in probiotics, including Akkermansia, Bacteroides and Faecalibacterium. However, the pathogen Aeromonas was markedly increased. By contrast, supplementation with 20 and 40 mg/kg melatonin reversed these SD-induced changes and improved the mucosal injury and dysbiosis of the microbiota in the colon. Our results suggest that the effect of SD on intestinal barrier dysfunction might be an outcome of melatonin suppression rather than a loss of sleep per se. SD-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction involved the suppression of melatonin production and activation of the NF-κB pathway by oxidative stress. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Three different synbiotics were administered with feed to animals from three experimental groups. Two groups of sows were given commercially available probiotics (BioPlus 2B®, Cylactin® LBC) as forage additives for comparison. The control group of sows was given unmodified fodder. The study was conducted for 48 days (10 days before farrowing, and continued 38 days after) and faeces samples were collected four times. The scope of this work was to designate the dominant microbiota in sows' faeces. Therefore, the total number of anaerobic bacteria, Bifidobacterium sp., Lactobacillus sp., Bacteroides sp., Clostridium sp., Enterococcus sp., Enterobacteriaceae, Escherichia coli and yeast was determined, using the plate method. Changes in the concentration of lactic acid, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and branched-chain fatty acids (BCFAs) were also determined in correlation with the feed additives administered to the sows using high-performance liquid chromatography analysis (HPLC). Our results allowed us to conclude that synbiotics have a beneficial effect on intestinal microbiota of sows and its metabolism.

Amelioration of AAGS in cats secondary to synbiotic administration has recently been demonstrated. Thus, the aim of this randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial was to characterize associated changes in the fecal microbiome and metabolome. Sixteen healthy research cats received clindamycin with food, followed 1 h later by either a placebo or synbiotic, daily for 21 days. Fecal samples were collected during baseline, antibiotic administration, and 6 weeks after antibiotic discontinuation. Sequencing of 16S rRNA genes was performed, and mass spectrometry was used to determine fecal metabolomic profiles. Results were compared using mixed-model analyses, with P < 0.05 considered significant. Alpha and beta diversity were altered significantly during treatment, with persistent changes in the Shannon and dysbiosis indices. The relative abundance of Actinobacteria (Adlercreutzia, Bifidobacterium, Collinsella, Slackia), Bacteroidia (Bacteroides, Prevotella), Ruminococcaceae (Faecalibacterium, Ruminococcus), Veillonellaceae (Megamonas, Megasphaera, Phascolarctobacterium) and Erysipelotrichaceae ([Eubacterium]) decreased and relative abundance of Clostridiaceae (Clostridium) and Proteobacteria (Enterobacteriaceae) increased during treatment, followed by variable return to baseline relative abundances.

A total of 720, 4-week-old Shaver White chicks were allotted to control (CON), 1.1E+08 (low, LSSB), 2.2E+08 (medium, MSSB), or 1.1E_09 (high, HSSB) CFU/kg of diet groups. At grower (10-week), developer (16-week), and laying (28-week) phases, excreta and cecal digesta samples were taken for AR, microbial, and SCFA analyses. Microbial analysis involved high-throughput sequencing of the V3-V4 hypervariable regions of 16S rRNA gene. Bacterial diversity decreased (P < 0.05) at the developer phase as the SSB dose increased; however, a distinct clustering pattern (P < 0.05) of bacterial community was noted. Bacteroides and Faecalibacterium were differentially enriched in the developer for SSB-fed compared to CON-fed birds. Although no differences in microbial diversity were detected in grower and layer phases, different species of Clostridium (XVIII, XIVa, IV, and XIVb)—major butyrate producers—were identified in all phases, with stronger effect sizes for SSB-fed compared to CON-fed birds. Isobutyric acid was elevated in dose response (P = 0.034) in layer phase. In addition, the relative abundances of Alistipes, Lactobacillus, and Bifidobacterium were positively correlated (P < 0.05), with AR of most components for SSB-fed birds in the pullet phase. The results suggested that supplementing chickens’ diet with B. subtilis DSM 29784 may selectively enrich beneficial bacterial communities, which in turn are critical in promoting the growth and performance of hens. IMPORTANCE In egg-laying chickens, the trend in the move away from the cage to alternative housing systems and restriction in antimicrobial use requires alternative approaches to maintain health and prevent diseases. There is increased research and commercial interest toward alternative gut health solutions while improving the performance and product safety in poultry production systems. One such approach, in recognition of the importance of the gut microbial community, is the use of microbes as feed supplements (such as probiotics). Unlike meat-type chickens, studies assessing the efficacy of such microbial supplements are limited for egg-laying chickens. Thus, by conducting a comprehensive assessment of the hen microbiota in response to various levels of B. subtilis DSM 29784 during the pullet phase (grower and developer) and the layer phase, the present study demonstrates the importance of direct-fed microbes in modulating gut microbiome, which may relate to improved performance efficiency in the pullet and layer phases. © 2020.

To this end, a total of 14 healthy wild-type chickens were divided into two experimental groups. Each group was orally administrated with a daily dose of 109 colony-forming units (CFU) of 3D8 scFv-producing L. reuteri or wild-type (WT) for 35 days. Administration of L. reuteri/3D8 scFv significantly improved the body weight of chickens when compared to L. reuteri/WT group. The bacterial taxonomic composition of the fecal microbiota was determined by pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons. Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria were dominant phyla in two experimental groups. However, in 3D8 L. reuteri treatment groups at genus level, the Lactobacillus was highly abundant, being represented by 18.12%. In addition, serum levels of primary cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-4, and IGF1 were markedly reduced in the probiotic L. reuteri 3D8 group.

Depending on PF type (i.e. no addition, viable, inactivated) and AV addition (no/yes), 450 one-day-old Cobb male broilers were allocated in 6 treatments (CON, CON + A, ViP, ViP + A, InP and InP + A) according to a 3 × 2 factorial arrangement with 5 replicates of 15 broilers each for 42 days. Significant interactions (PPF × AV ≤ 0.05) between PF and AV administration were shown for the ileal mucosa-associated bacteria, the caecal digesta Lactobacillus spp., the molar ratio of the sum of valeric, hexanoic and heptanoic acids and the gene expressions of ileal and caecal IgA and ileal claudin 1. Avilamycin suppressed ileal digesta Lactobacillus spp. (PAV &lt; 0.001) and caecal digesta Clostridium perfringens subgroup (PAV = 0.018) and modulated the intestinal fermentation intensity and pattern. The viable PF had the higher levels of ileal digesta Bacteroides spp. (PPF = 0.021) and caecal digesta Lactobacillus spp. (PPF = 0.038) compared with the other two PF. Probiotic form modulated the microbial metabolic activity in the ileum and caeca with the viable PF being the most noteworthy in terms of effects regarded as beneficial. Furthermore, the viable PF resulted in reduced expression of caecal Toll-like receptors TLR2B (PPF = 0.026) and TLR4 (PPF = 0.011) and transcription factor NFΚΒ1 (PPF = 0.002), which could be considered as essential for limiting inflammation and preserving gut homeostasis. In conclusion, under non-challenge conditions, probiotic function was shown to depend on PF type and to a lesser degree on co-administration with AV.

This work has evaluated the selective fermentation of POS by potential probiotic Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains. POS were fully characterized based on molecular weight and proportion of neutral and acidic oligosaccharides. All the tested probiotic strains reached better growth results when SBP POS were added to the growth media than LP POS. On the other hand, while Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG showed poor growth with LP POS-2, Bifidobacterium lactis Bb-12 was the only strain able to ferment these compounds. Lactic, acetic and formic acids were the main organic acids derived from POS fermentation by the assayed strains. The cocultures with Bacteroides fragilis did not modify the fermentation capability of the probiotic bacteria. This study has demonstrated that complex POS derived from lemon and sugar beet byproducts could be used as carbohydrate source by lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, showing the low-molecular-weight LP POS-2 a specific bifidogenic effect towards B. lactis.

Lactobacillus helveticus NS8, which was originally separated from fermented koumiss, exhibited anti-inflammatory functions in our prior studies. In this study, NS8 was investigated for its potential to prevent colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC). Methods: The protective effects of NS8 against CAC was explored by employing the azoxymethane plus dextran sodium sulfate-induced carcinogenesis mouse model. The prevalences of T cells expressing specific inflammatory cytokines were measured by flow cytometry at the early stage of CAC. Inflammatory modulation by NS8 was also tested in the Caco2-Raw264.7 cell co-culture system. The alternations in the intestinal microbiota following the health–inflammation–cancer sequence were analyzed by 16S rDNA sequencing. Results: Oral intake of NS8 lactobacilli clearly reduced tumor number and the degree of hyperplasia. The increased proliferation of enterocytes at the early stage of CAC was significantly suppressed by NS8, while the level of apoptosis was elevated. The anticancer effects of NS8 were associated with its anti-colitis outcomes before tumor formation. NS8 significantly suppressed the activation of NF-κB and upregulated the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Further analysis revealed the marked downregulation of IL-17-producing T cells by NS8. Furthermore, NS8 modulated intestinal dysbiosis by promoting beneficial commensal microbes while suppressing cancer-associated microbes. Notably, Bacteroides acidifaciens was the most sensitive commensal bacteria to NS8 intervention.

The balance of gut microbiome is highly crucial for a healthy human body, especially for the immune and endocrine system. However, the relationship between gut microbiome and the thyroid endocrine disorders such as thyroid cancer and thyroid nodules has not been reported yet. Methods: A cohort of 74 patients was recruited for this study. Among them, 20 patients had thyroid cancer, 18 patients had thyroid nodules, and 36 were matched healthy controls. Gut microbiome composition was analyzed by 16S rRNA (16S ribosomal RNA) gene-based sequencing protocol. Results: We compared the gut microbiome results of 74 subjects and established the correlation between gut microbiome and thyroid endocrine function for both thyroid cancer and thyroid nodules. The results inferred that alpha and beta diversity were different for patients with thyroid tumor than the healthy controls (p < 0.01). In comparison to healthy controls, the relative abundance of Neisseria (p < 0.001) and Streptococcus (p < 0.001) was significantly higher for thyroid cancer and thyroid nodules. Butyricimonas (p < 0.001) and Lactobacillus (p < 0.001) displayed notably lower relative abundance for thyroid cancer and thyroid nodules, respectively.

Most of these biological activities are derived from (3S,3′S)-astaxanthin, while the activities of (3R,3′R)-astaxanthin are rarely reported. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of (3R,3′R)-astaxanthin on lipid metabolism and gut microbiota in mice fed with a high-fat diet. In this work, 40 male C57BL/6 mice were divided into 8 groups fed a high-fat diet supplemented or not with (3R,3′R)-astaxanthin or Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous for 8 weeks. The weight gain, energy intake, fat index, plasma triacylglycerol and cholesterol, liver triacylglycerol and cholesterol, and gut microbiota were determined. The results showed that the addition of (3R,3′R)-astaxanthin/X. dendrorhous to the highfat diet as a supplement prevented weight gain, reduced plasma and liver triacylglycerol, and decreased plasma and liver total cholesterol. The addition of (3R,3′R)-astaxanthin/X. dendrorhous also regulated the gut microbiota of the mice, which optimized the ratio of Bacteroides to Firmicutes and increased the content of Verrucomicrobia, especially Akkermansia. The changes in the gut microflora achieved a healthier structure, thus reducing the incidence of obesity. Thus (3R,3′R)-Astaxanthin has the function of regulating lipid metabolism and gut microbiota to prevent obesity caused by a high-fat diet. The production strain of (3R,3′R)-astaxanthin, X. dendrorhous, has the same function as astaxanthin in preventing obesity caused by a high-fat diet, which reflects its potential ability as a probiotic drug. © 2019 by the authors.",22.0

While studies have shown that these measures can be clinically beneficial to premature babies, and there are ongoing trials to measure their impact on NEC and sepsis rates, little is known about how they may impact microbiota development. We thus employed a newborn piglet model to assess the impact of feeding probiotics or a combination of probiotics and lactoferrin on development of the gastrointestinal microbiota. Healthy full-term piglets were fed either probiotics alone or probiotics and a bovine lactoferrin supplement over the first weeks of life, and their microbiota profiles were compared with unsupplemented controls. We found that both probiotic and probiotic plus lactoferrin treatments impacted the microbial composition within the gastrointestinal tract, with differing impacts on various regions within the gut. In addition, the impact of probiotics was often reversed by the presence of lactoferrin and both feeding interventions altered the microbiota’s genetic propensity to use ferric versus ferrous ions.

On the 90th day of gestation, the saliva and fresh stool of sows were individually collected in the morning (06:00–07:00)for steroid hormones, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)and microbiome analysis. In addition, the parameter of pregnant behavioral and farrowing performance was recorded and evaluated. We observed that, as compared with the 2.5% CF treatment, 7.5% CF significantly increased the litter size (p = 0.01), reduced the stereotypic behaviors including sham chewing, rolling tongue and licking ground (p = 0.02, 0.04, 0.01)at later gestation stage, but increased lying time (p = 0.00). In coincide with this, 7.5% CF diet increased the salivary progesterone (p = 0.00), fecal estradiol and progesterone (p = 0.01, 0.02)level, fecal water and SCFAs content (p = 0.02, 0.03), decreased the salivary and fecal cortisol (p = 0.01, 0.00)level. Further, 7.5% CF diet increased the fecal microbiota richness (ACE, p = 0.04; Chao, p = 0.07)and diversity (Shannon, p = 0.01; Simpson, p = 0.04), the proportion of genus Ruminococcus, Butyrivibrio, Lactobacillus and Fibrobacter (p = 0.02, 0.05, 0.04, 0.00), whereas reduced the proportion of genus Clostridium, Streptococcus, Bacteroides and Escherichia-Shigella (p = 0.00, 0.00, 0.04, 0.04). These results indicate that, fibrous diet can regulate the steroid hormones secretion and modulate the gut with more cellulose-degrading and probiotic bacterium, but less opportunistic pathogens, and this may contribute to the improvement of reproductive performance and welfare in sows. © 2019",14.0

Exploitation of prebiotics and probiotics for modulation of gut microbiota can lead to promising outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of the probiotic strain Bifidobacterium longum BB-46 alone and in combination with a citric pectin from lemon on the gut microbiota from healthy adults using the Simulator of Human Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem (SHIME ® ). Changes in microbiota composition and in metabolic activity were assessed by the 16S rRNA gene sequencing and by analyses of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and ammonium ions (NH 4 + ). An increase in the relative abundances of Firmicutes (especially the members of Lachnospiraceae and Lactobacillaceae families) and Bacteroidetes was observed during treatment with B. longum BB-46 alone in all compartments of the colon. Treatment with B. longum BB-46 and pectin stimulated an increase in the proportions of genera Faecalibacterium, Eubacterium and Lactobacillus, as well as in the Ruminococcaceae family in the transverse and descending colons. Concurrently, the butyrate levels increased in these two compartments. Additionally, the combination of B. longum BB-46 and pectin reduced the abundance of proteolytic bacteria Bacteroides, Clostridium, Peptoniphilus, and Streptococcus, along with decreased NH 4 + production. No significant changes could be observed on NH 4 + production by treatment with B. longum BB-46, nor did it increase the amount of SCFAs. In this study, we observed that although each treatment was able to modulate the microbiota, the combination of B. longum BB-46 and pectin was more efficient in decreasing the intestinal NH 4 + levels and in increasing butyric acid-producing bacteria. These findings indicate that B. longum BB-46, especially when combined with the specific citric pectin, might have beneficial impact on human health. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",16.0

Moreover, stress leads to anxiety and depressive disorders. Bifidobacterium adolescentis displays distinct anti-inflammatory effects. However, no report has focused on the anxiolytic and antidepressant effects of B. adolescentis related to the gut microbiome and the inflammation on chronic restraint stress (CRS) in mice. We found that pretreatment with B. adolescentis increased the time spent in the center of the open field apparatus, increased the percentage of entries into the open arms of the elevated plus-maze (EPM) and the percentage of time spent in the open arms of the EPM, and decreased the immobility duration in the tail suspension test as well as the forced swimming test (FST). Moreover, B. adolescentis increased the sequence proportion of Lactobacillus and reduced the sequence proportion of Bacteroides in feces. Furthermore, B. adolescentis markedly reduced the protein expression of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), p-nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) p65 and Iba1 and elevated brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression in the hippocampus. We conclude that the anxiolytic and antidepressant effects of B. adolescentis are related to reducing inflammatory cytokines and rebalancing the gut microbiota. © 2019 Guo, Xie, Deng, Li, Yuan, Xuan, Xie, He, Wang, Li and Luo.",29.0

However, recent epidemiological and experimental data suggest that dysregulated maternal immune activation (MIA) can impede normal brain maturation and promote the development of autism-related phenotypes. Indeed, our studies and work by others demonstrate that offspring born to pregnant animals that were exposed to immune activators develop many of the defining behavioral features of ASD, including abnormalities in social preference, communicative impairments, and repetitive/stereotyped behaviors. Although mounting evidence implicates key roles for hyperactive gestational inflammatory responses in neurodevelopmental disorders, the specific immune pathways that provoke autism-related phenotypes remain poorly described. The microbiome is recognized as a key modulator of immune responses, and emerging studies suggest that microbiota composition is a pivotal regulator of central nervous system function and disease. There has been growing speculation that changes in human microflora diversity contribute at some level to the recent rise in autism incidence. This has largely stemmed from reports of dysbiosis and gastrointestinal inflammation in autistic individuals. Given these clinical findings and the well-described role of the microbiome in calibrating the immune system, our group and others have recently become interested in investigating how changes in microbiota landscape influence neurodevelopmental disorder pathogenesis. In this review, we highlight emerging data describing roles for microbiota in the development of autism-related behavioral abnormalities. These recent findings identify the immune system as a link between gut microbiota and the brain in neurodevelopmental disorders, and suggest that targeting the microbiome and maternal immune responses during gestation may offer strategies to limit autism development in at-risk pregnancies.

Methods and Results: Bacterial communities from eight different eels' intestinal sites (including the intestinal contents and the intestinal mucosa) from three fish groups (three fast-, two medium-, and three stunted-growth samples), two water samples, and one diet sample were characterized by Illumina next-generation sequencing. The data revealed that the predominant genera (relative abundance of bacteria genera >1%) in the intestine of fast- and medium-growth groups were Cetobacterium, Edwardsiella, Clostridium, Lactococcus, Bacteroides, Plesiomonas and Akkermansia. The dominant genus in the stunted-growth group was Spiroplasma. Moreover, culture-associated (water and feed) environmental microbes were distinct from those present in fish intestines, and included Flavobacterium (the dominant bacteria in water) and Corynebacterium (the dominant bacteria in feed). Conclusions: Only minor differences in gut microbial communities were observed between the fast-growth group and the medium-growth group; however, significant differences were observed between the normal-growth group (including the fast-growth group and medium-growth group, which showed uninhibited growth during the rearing stage) and the stunted-growth group. Together, these data suggested that intestinal microbes were significantly associated with marbled eels’ growth rate. Significance and Impact of the Study: In this study, we demonstrated for the first time, the intestinal bacterial communities of A. marmorata at different growth rates. Moreover, we found that the genus Spiroplasma was abundant in the guts of stunted-growth eels, which had never been noticed. Such a finding indicates that the genus Spiroplasma plays a key role associated with retardation in growth and should be controlled to recover the growth of stunted eels, which is meaningful to farmers. © 2018 The Society for Applied Microbiology",15.0

Different types of RMD and RS are used as the sole carbon sources for bacteria in feces from healthy volunteers. The cultured samples are analyzed for changes in microbial groups from which the prebiotic index (PI) is calculated. The metabolic activity of the microbiotal communities is monitored by efficiency of carbon utilization and short chain fatty acid (SCFA) profiling. Bifidobacteria and lactobacilli are found to be increased whereas clostridia (histolyticum subgroup) and bacteroides are decreased. RMD is more efficiently utilized than RS showing up to 78% of carbon source consumption. Utilization of RS provides the highest content of propionic and butyric acid while RMD shows a higher content of acetic and lactic acid. RMD and RS show a superior PI compared to that of glucose. Different types of molecular stearic hindrances, configurational hindrance for RMD, and conformational/aggregational hindrance for RS, prevent their hydrolytic utilization, directly influencing the human gut microbiotal composition and/or fermentation capability in different manners. RMD demonstrates the highest acetic acid content while RS3 and RS4 provide the highest butyric acid content. © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim",4.0

The strains of lactic acid bacteria were previously isolated from a fermented food (ripened cheese) and several ones resulted to have promising probiotic characteristics. Based on comprehensive evaluation of the data obtained, one strain was chosen and supplemented in a fermented milk. The fermented milk was then used in the administration trial with the goal of assessing its effect on the composition of the intestinal microbiota, as reflected in the feces. The fermented milk, with or without probiotic, had an effect on the intestinal microbiota and significant inter-individual differences were observed in response to the intervention. A common trend was observed related to two important populations of the human gut microbiota; a reduction in the relative abundance of Bacteroides and increase in the abundance of Prevotella in subjects during treatment compared to baseline were registered. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",14.0

Intestinal colonization by antibiotic-resistant pathogens, however, can lead to the spread of resistance as well as serious infections. Extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E) represent particularly dangerous pathogens, which are known to asymptomatically colonize the intestinal tract in the community. Here, we performed a 16S rRNA metagenomics sequence analysis to analyse differences in the microbiota composition between ESBL-E carriers and non-carriers in Thailand, where ESBL-E carriage rates are notoriously high. The most notable difference detected was that the phylum Bacteroidetes, and in particular, the species Bacteroides uniformis, were significantly more abundant in ESBL-E non-carriers than carriers. The Shannon diversity index in non-carriers (5.10 ± 0.69) was also lower than that in ESBL-E carriers (5.39 ± 0.48) without statistical significance (P=0.13). The overall beta diversity difference of the intestinal microbiota of ESBL-E carriers as compared to non-carriers was statistically significant (Adonis on weighted unifrac: R 2 =0.14, P=0.005). Furthermore, ESBL-E carriage was significantly lower in farmers than in those with other occupations. Our findings suggest that a dynamic interaction exists between microbiota diversity and ESBL-E carriage, which is possibly driven by dietary composition and may be exploited using probiotic approaches to control the spread of ESBL-E. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",9.0

Herein, we investigated the synbiotic interaction between the Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain GG (LGG; a probiotic strain) and tagatose (a prebiotic) in a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis murine model. Initially, body weight, food intake, and clinical features were dramatically decreased after treatment with DSS, and the addition of LGG, tagatose, or both ameliorated these effects. In our pyrosequencing analysis of fecal microbiota, DSS treatment increased the abundance of Proteobacteria and decreased that of Firmicutes. When LGG and tagatose were administered as synbiotics, the gut microbiota composition recovered from the dysbiosis caused by DSS treatment. In particular, the abundance of Bacteroides, Lactobacillus, and Akkermansia was significantly associated with probiotic, prebiotic, and synbiotic treatments. Taken together, our results suggest that LGG and tagatose as synbiotics can alleviate colitis, and synbiotics could be applied as dietary supplements in dairy foods such as yogurt and cheese. © 2019 American Dairy Science Association",14.0

In this study, we isolated Kazachstania turicensis CAU Y1706, commonly known as a kefir yeast, and evaluated its mitigating effects using an ovalbumin-sensitized AD mouse model. Overall, K. turicensis CAU Y1706 was generally effective against AD. Oral administration of K. turicensis CAU Y1706 suppressed T helper type 2 immune response factors by regulatory T cells and upregulation of T helper type 1 cytokine levels. Kazachstania turicensis CAU Y1706 also reduced IgE levels as well as the number of eosinophil and mast cells. Furthermore, feces from K. turicensis CAU Y1706-treated mice had more butyrate-producing bacteria, such as Lactobacillus, Bacteroides, Ruminococcus, and Akkermansia, although the level of Fecalibacterium was significantly reduced.

Knowing the importance of the microbiome in the regulation of bone density, we investigated the effect of postantibiotic treatment on gut and bone health. Intestinal microbiome repopulation at 4-weeks postantibiotic treatment resulted in an increase in the Firmicutes:Bacteroidetes ratio, increased intestinal permeability, and notably reduced femoral trabecular bone volume (approximately 30%, p < 0.01). Treatment with a mucus supplement (a high-molecular-weight polymer, MDY-1001 [MDY]) prevented the postantibiotic-induced barrier break as well as bone loss, indicating a mechanistic link between increased intestinal permeability and bone loss. A link between the microbiome composition and bone density was demonstrated by supplementing the mice with probiotic bacteria. Specifically, Lactobacillus reuteri, but not Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG or nonpathogenic Escherichia coli, reduced the postantibiotic elevation of the Firmicutes:Bacteroidetes ratio and prevented femoral and vertebral trabecular bone loss. Consistent with causing bone loss, postantibiotic-induced dysbiosis decreased osteoblast and increased osteoclast activities, changes that were prevented by both L. reuteri and MDY. These data underscore the importance of microbial dysbiosis in the regulation of intestinal permeability and bone health, as well as identify L. reuteri and MDY as novel therapies for preventing these adverse effects. © 2018 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research. © 2018 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research",56.0

Probiotics treatment can effectively modulate intestinal microbiota. However, it remains unclear whether probiotics can effectively improve HFD- and HCD-induced microbiota dysbiosis. Methods: Mice were fed either an HFD, HCD, or normal diet for 13 wk and administered probiotics during the last 4 wk of the diet. Fecal and cecal samples were collected and analyzed by high-throughput 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing. Results: Body weight increased more in the HFD group compared with the HCD group. Probiotics supplementation slowed weight gain in both the HFD and HCD groups. Both the HFD and HCD reduced microbial diversity, abundance of butyric acid–producing bacteria, and some other beneficial bacteria, including Lactobacillus, Clostridium sensu stricto, Prevotella, and Alloprevotella, but increased conditional pathogenic bacteria, such as Bacteroides, Alistipes, and Anaerotruncus. Probiotics markedly restored the proportions of bacteria affected in the HFD and HCD groups and increased the abundance of microbiota negatively associated with obesity, including Bifidobacterium, Lactococcus, and Akkermansia. In addition, Oscillibacter, Escherichia/Shigella, Acinetobacter, and Blautia significantly increased in the HCD group; Allobaculum, Olsenella, and Ruminococcus were significantly changed in the HFD group. HCD-induced microbiota dysbiosis was more susceptible to probiotics treatment compared with the HFD. Conclusions: Probiotics treatment can mitigate diet-induced obesity partly through modulating intestinal microbiota, especially in HCD-induced obesity. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",127.0

Thus, there has been rapid growth in the study of gut microbiota. Considering the numerous factors influencing gut microbiota such as age, diet, etc., area-based research is required. Indonesia has numerous different tribes and each of these tribes have different lifestyles. Hence, it is expected that each tribe has a specific gut microbiota. A deeper insight into the composition of gut microbiota can be used to determine the condition of gut microbiota in Indonesians and to consider which treatment may be suitable and effective to improve health status. AIM To investigate the gut microbiota of Indonesian subjects represented by Javanese and Balinese tribes by analyzing fecal samples. METHODS Fecal samples were collected from a total of 80 individuals with 20 in each of the young groups ranging from 25-45 years and the elderly group aged 70 years or more from two different regions, Yogyakarta and Bali. Fecal sample collection was performed at the end of the assessment period (day 14 ± 1 d) during which time the subjects were not allowed to consume probiotic or antibiotic products. The quantification of various Clostridium subgroups, Lactobacillus subgroups, Enterococcus, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Bacteroides fragilis group and Prevotella, Bifidobacterium and Atopobium cluster, Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas was performed using the Yakult intestinal flora-scan (YIF-SCAN). RESULTS The bacterial population in younger subjects' feces was higher than that in the elderly population, with a total of approximately 10.0 - 10.6 log10 bacterial cells/g feces. The most abundant bacteria in all groups were Clostridium, followed by Prevotella, Atopobium, Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides. In the elderly, an increase in Enterobacteriaceae, Coliform and Escherichia coli was found. In terms of bacterial counts in Yogyakarta, total bacteria, Clostridium coccoides (C. coccoides) group, Bifidobacterium, Prevotella, Lactobacillus plantarum subgroup, and Streptococcus were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in younger than elderly subjects, while the Lactobacillus gasseri subgroup, Lactobacillus casei subgroup, and Lactobacillus reuteri subgroup counts were significantly lower (P < 0.05) in younger subjects. In Balinese subjects, total bacteria, C. coccoides group, Clostridium leptum subgroup, Bacteroides fragilis group, and Prevotella were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in younger compared to elderly individuals, while the Lactobacillus ruminis subgroup, and Enterobacteriaceae were significantly lower (P < 0.05) in younger subjects. The results also revealed that, besides the C. coccoides group and Clostridium leptum group being the most abundant gut microbiota in both Yogyakarta and Balinese people, the latter was indicated by a higher Clostridium perfringens count, which was almost 10 times that of Yogyakarta subjects. This may be a response to different lifestyles in the different tribes; however, this phenomenon requires further extensive study. CONCLUSION Bacterial populations were higher in younger than in elderly subjects. Most abundant bacterial groups were Clostridium, Prevotella, Atopobium, Bifidobacterium, and Bacteroides. The level of Clostridium perfringens in Yogyakarta subjects was lower than that in Balinese subjects. © The Author(s) 2019.",12.0

In CRC research, the most common samples are feces and tumor tissues. Interestingly, scientists have quite different views regarding gut microbiota composition of feces and tissues. Some believe bacterial populations in feces and mucosa are completely distinct and differ in composition and diversity while some others declare similar variations. Actually, both types of specimens have some advantages and disadvantages in survey of gut microbiota.

The microbiome can be changed by diet, probiotics, and faecal transplants, which has flow-on effects to health outcomes. Photobiomodulation has a therapeutic effect on inflammation and neurological disorders (amongst others) and has been reported to influence metabolic disorders and obesity. The aim of this study was to examine the possibility that PBM could influence the microbiome of mice. Mice had their abdomen irradiated with red (660 nm) or infrared (808 nm) low-level laser, either as single or multiple doses, over a 2-week period. Genomic DNA extracted from faecal pellets was pyrosequenced for the 16S rRNA gene. There was a significant (p < 0.05) difference in microbial diversity between PBM- and sham-treated mice. One genus of bacterium (Allobaculum) significantly increased (p < 0.001) after infrared (but not red light) PBM by day 14. Despite being a preliminary trial with small experimental numbers, we have demonstrated for the first time that PBM can alter microbiome diversity in healthy mice and increase numbers of Allobaculum, a bacterium associated with a healthy microbiome. This change is most probably a result of PBMt affecting the host, which in turn influenced the microbiome. If this is confirmed in humans, the possibility exists for PBMt to be used as an adjunct therapy in treatment of obesity and other lifestyle-related disorders, as well as cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. The clinical implications of altering the microbiome using PBM warrants further investigation. © 2018, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",17.0

Previous studies have indicated that the composition of gut microflora may be involved in CAC induction and progress. Bacteroides fragilis (BF) is a Gram-negative anaerobe belonging to colonic symbiotic bacteria of the host. This study was aimed to investigate the protective role of BF in a colorectal cancer (CRC) model induced by azoxymethane (AOM) and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in germ-free (GF) mice. Materials and methods: Total 22 GF mice were divided into two groups: GF and BF group. Half of the GF mice were colonized with BF for 28 days before CRC induction by AOM/DSS. Results:BF colonization increased animal survival (100%). Cecum weight and cecum/body weight ratio significantly decreased in BF/AOM/DSS group. Interestingly, there was a significant decrease in tumor number and tumor incidence in the BF/AOM/DSS group as compared to the GF/AOM/DSS group. The adenocarcinoma/adenoma incidence and histologic score were also decreased in the BF/AOM/DSS group. In addition, immunohistochemistry staining found decreased numbers of cell proliferation (PCNA) and inflammatory cell (granulocytes) infiltration in the colon mucosa of the BF group. The β-catenin staining in the BF/AOM/DSS group had fewer and weaker positive signal expressions. Taking together, the BF colonization significantly ameliorated AOM/DSS-induced CRC by suppressing the activity of cell proliferation-related molecules and reducing the number of inflammatory cells.

Our previous study showed that LAO1 is present in mouse milk and exerts protection against bacteria by its production of H2O2. The data led us to consider whether LAO1, H2O2, or both could impact infant gut microbiota development via mother's milk consumption in mice. Different gut microbiota profiles were observed in the wild-type (WT) and LAO1-knockout mouse pups. The WT pups' microbiota was relatively simple and composed of only a few dominant bacteria, such as Lactobacillus, whereas the lactating knockout pups had high microbiota diversity. Cross-fostering experiments indicated that WT milk (containing LAO1) has the ability to suppress the diversity of microbiota in pups. We observed that the stomach content of pups fed WT milk had LAO1 proteins and the ability to produce H2O2. Moreover, culture experiments showed that Lactobacillus was abundant in the feces of pups fed WT milk and that Lactobacillus was more resistant to H2O2 than Bifidobacterium and Escherichia. Human breast milk produces very little H2O2, which could be the reason for Lactobacillus not being dominant in the feces of breast-fed human infants. In mouse mother's milk, H2O2 is generated from the process of free amino acid metabolism, and H2O2 may be a key player in regulating the initial acquisition and development of gut microbiota, especially growth of Lactobacillus, during infancy.—Shigeno, Y., Zhang, H., Banno, T., Usuda, K., Nochi, T., Inoue, R., Watanabe, G., Jin, W., Benno, Y., Nagaoka, K.

Recent work in humans has demonstrated that the first year of life is the most critical time period for microbiome development with perturbations during this time being proven to have long term health consequences. In this review, we describe the literature surrounding early life events in humans and mice that contribute to intestinal microbiota development and function, and compare this to piglets predominantly during their lactation period, which focuses on the impact lactation management practices may have on the intestinal microbiota. Although extensive research has been conducted in this area in humans and mice, little research exists in pigs during perceivably the most critical time period of development, which is the lactation period. The research reviewed outlines the importance of appropriate intestinal microbiota development. However, further research is needed in order to understand the full extent routine farm practices have on a piglet’s intestinal microbiota. © 2019 by the authors.

PFM and YC habits were analyzed in 260 subjects (51% male) by specific questionnaires, and the following groups were considered: (1) PFM groups: nonconsumers (PFM-NC, n = 175) and consumers (PFM, n = 85), divided as follows: Bifidobacterium-containing PFM (Bif-PFM; n = 33), Lactobacillus-containing PFM (Lb-PFM; n = 14), and mixed Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus-containing PFM (Mixed-PFM; n = 38); (2) PFM-NC were classified as: yogurt nonconsumers (Y-NC; n = 40) and yogurt consumers (n = 135). GM was analyzed through 16S rRNA sequencing. PFM consumers showed higher Bifidobacteria taxa levels compared to NC, from phylum through to species. Specifically, Bif-PFM consumption was related to higher B. animalis levels (p < 0.001), whereas Lb-PFM consumption was associated to higher levels of Bifidobacterium (p < 0.045) and B. longum (p = 0.011). YC was related to higher levels of the yogurt starter Streptococcus thermophilus (p < 0.001). Lactobacilli and the overall GM were not related either to YC or PFM consumption.

Single nucleotide polymorphism- and metagenomic assembly-based strain tracking revealed large and highly dynamic microbial pangenomes, especially in the genus Bacteroides, in which we identified evidence of variability deriving from Bacteroides-targeting bacteriophages. Our analyses revealed functional consequences of strain diversity; only 10% of Finnish infants harboured Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis, a subspecies specialized in human milk metabolism, whereas Russian infants commonly maintained a probiotic Bifidobacterium bifidum strain in infancy.

Due to their potential applications in diverse sectors, such as food, biotechnology, cosmetics, and medicine, EPSs synthesized by bifidobacteria have recently attracted more attention. EPS production not only has benefits in food and health but also has effects on probiotics in the microbial ecosystem. In this study, we investigated the interaction between bifidobacteria EPSs and human gut microbiota in vitro using thin-layer chromatography, 16S rDNA high-throughput sequencing, and gas chromatography. The results showed that human gut microbiota has the capacity to degrade EPSs, although the degradation rate was approximately 50% after fermenting for 48 h. On the other hand, EPSs regulate the human gut microbiota. Fermented samples in the VI_Bif group clustered together according to the bacterial community compared to the VI_Starch group, in which starch was added as a carbon source. The bifidobacteria EPS promoted the growth of phylum Deinococcus_Thermus, class Deinococci, order Deinococcales, and genus Coprococcus. EPSs also increased the production of propionic acid compared to the starch group. The detection results of Dionex ICS 5000 high-purity capillary ion chromatography system showed that EPSs had absorption peaks of fucose, rhamnose, galactose/acetyl glucosamine, glucose, and ribose, and the molecular proportion of these monosaccharides was approximately 2: 2: 440: 3: 53. The monosaccharide composition of this EPS appears to be more complex than previously reported for bifidobacteria EPS.

This study investigated the effect of consuming the probiotic Bifidobacterium breve A-1 on anxiety and depressive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia and explored its effect on immune products such as cytokines and chemokines. Methods: In this open-label single-arm study, all participants received B. breve strain A-1 (10 11 cfu/day) for 4 weeks followed by 4 weeks of observation. The primary outcome was the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) score. Secondary outcomes were anxiety and depressive symptoms on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), blood test findings, and fecal microbiome composition. Results: Twenty-nine outpatients completed the study. HADS total score and PANSS anxiety/depression score were significantly improved at 4 weeks. Based on the criterion of a greater than 25% reduction in HADS total score at 4 weeks from baseline, there were 12 responders and 17 non-responders. Responders were found to have fewer negative symptoms, reduced intake of dairy products, and higher relative abundance of Parabacteroides in the gut microbiome than non-responders. Moreover, IL-22 and TRANCE expression was significantly increased at 4 weeks from baseline in responders but not in non-responders. Limitations: This open-label, single-arm study cannot exclude a placebo effect. Conclusions: The results suggest the potential effect of B. breve A-1 in improving anxiety and depressive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia.

We previously reported that a combination of 3 oligosaccharides (lactulose, raffinose, and galactooligosaccharides; LRG) and Bifidobacterium breve effectively increased B. breve numbers, acetate, and the expression of several immune- and gut hormone-related mRNAs in neonatal mice gut. Objective:We investigated whether changes in neonatal gut microbiota alter gut immune and endocrine development. Methods:We first compared postnatal day (PD) 14 with PD21 in C57BL/6J male mouse pups to identify the physiologic immune and endocrine changes during development. In a separate study, we administered phosphate-buffered saline (control group; CON), B. breve M-16V (M-16V), or M-16V + LRG to male mouse pups from PD6 to PD13, and analyzed the gut microbiota and immune and endocrine parameters on PD14 to evaluate whether M-16V + LRG accelerates gut immune and endocrine development. Results: The proportion of regulatory T (Treg) cells in the CD4+ cells of large intestinal lamina propria lymphocytes (LPLs) was significantly increased (63% higher) at PD21 compared with PD14. The serum glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 tended to be lower (P = 0.0515) and that of GLP-2 was significantly lower (58% lower) at PD21 than at PD14. M-16V + LRG significantly increased the Treg proportion in large intestinal LPL CD4+ cells (20% and 29% higher compared with CON andM-16V, respectively) at PD14. M-16V + LRG also caused significant changes in expression of large intestinal mRNAs that are consistent with developmental progression, and increased serum concentrations of GLP-1 (207% and 311% higher compared with CON and M-16V, respectively) and GLP-2 (57% and 97% higher compared with CON and M-16V, respectively) at PD14. Conclusions: Neonatal administration of M-16V + LRG alters the gut microbiota and enhances gut immune and endocrine development in suckling mice.

Four arabinoxylans extracts were obtained from Argentinian soft and hard wheat. In vitro assays were performed to describe the extent to which the extracts from whole wheat flour support selective growth of Bifidobacterium breve and probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri ATCC23272 in a defined media. The prebiotic effect was evaluated by three quantitative scores: relative growth, prebiotic activity score and prebiotic index. For prebiotic index equation the growth of Bacteroides and Clostridium strains was compared to that of bifidobacteria and lactic acid bacteria. All the arabinoxylans extracts supported the growth of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, reaching higher prebiotic activity score values than inulin (0·37 and 0·36 for Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium respectively). AX2 from soft wheat and AX4 from hard showed similar prebiotic index value to commercial inulin (2·64, 2·52 and 2·22 respectively), and AX3 extract presented higher prebiotic index value (4·09) than the positive control and other prebiotic index reported for arabinoxylans. These extracts could be used as prebiotic, synbiotic compositions or novel food prototypes to treat dysbiosis associated with many diseases. Significance and Impact of the Study: The present work demonstrates that AX extracts from Argentinian soft and hard wheat promote efficiently the growth of probiotic strain L. reuteri ATCC23272 and B. breve 286, validated with three different parameters that consider the growth of representative strains of Bacteria genera found in the gut. The evaluation of AX extracts as a food supplement in a murine model could confirm their ability to modulate the microbiome. Novel food prototypes including AX and probiotics could relieve local symptoms and may act as psychobiotics with a beneficial effect on microbiome-brain axis. © 2018 The Society for Applied Microbiology",10.0

Several recent clinical studies have linked the microbiome with neuropsychiatric conditions, although the literature on schizophrenia is quite limited. This study investigated gut microbiome composition in 50 individuals, including 25 persons with chronic schizophrenia and 25 demographically-matched non-psychiatric comparison subjects (NCs). Stool samples were collected and assayed using 16S rRNA sequencing of the V4 region. Examination of unweighted UniFrac and Bray-Curtis dissimilarity revealed significant community-level separation in microbiome composition between the two subject groups. At the phylum level, Proteobacteria were found to be relatively decreased in schizophrenia subjects compared to NCs. At the genus level, Anaerococcus was relatively increased in schizophrenia while Haemophilus, Sutterella, and Clostridium were decreased. Within individuals with schizophrenia, abundance of Ruminococcaceae was correlated with lower severity of negative symptoms; Bacteroides was associated with worse depressive symptoms; and Coprococcus was related to greater risk for developing coronary heart disease. Our findings provide evidence of altered gut microbial composition in persons with chronic schizophrenia and suggest a need for larger and longitudinal studies of microbiome in schizophrenia. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",74.0

Here, we show that these GL34 compounds are largely resistant to the hydrolytic activities of common carbohydrate-degrading enzymes. Also, the ability of single strains of gut bacteria, bifidobacteria, lactobacilli, and commensal bacteria, to ferment the GL34 compounds was studied. Bifidobacteria clearly grew better on the GL34 mixture than lactobacilli and commensal bacteria. Lactobacilli and the commensal bacteria Escherichia coli Nissle and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron only degraded the F2 compound α-D-Glcp-(1 → 2)-[β-D-Galp-(1 → 4)-]D-Glcp, constituting around 30% w/w of GL34. Bifidobacteria digested more than one compound from the GL34 mixture, varying with the specific strain tested. Bifidobacterium adolescentis was most effective, completely degrading four of the five GL34 compounds, leaving only one minor constituent.

Several materials components have been implicated in the development and excessive activation of the immune system, acting as irritants and allergic agents. In several studies, in Mediterranean inhabitants with a specific diet, the prevalence of allergies in children was low, whereas dietary supplements in the Western and Mediterranean countries had a different role in the regulation of immune responses and in the reduction of allergic reactions. Probiotics have been associated with reduction of allergic reactions mostly by positive effect on T helper cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs), B cells and dendritic cells. Furthermore, probiotics existing in the human intestine can modulate the immune response and allergic reactions through downregulation of Th2-related responses (IgE, IL-4 and IL-5). They mostly exert anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties by modulation of immune system components via hindering of various signaling pathways such as the NF-kB pathway, probably associated with changes in mitogen-activated protein kinases and pattern recognition receptors pathways. These microorganisms have also potential to inhibit the bacterial lipopolysaccharide attachment to the CD14 receptor, hence reducing the overall activation of NF-kB and proinflammatory cytokines production. Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus species act through increase in proinflammatory (Th1) cytokines (INF-g, IL-12, IL-13, TNF-a and also IL-4 and IL-10), dendritic cells, CD4+FoxP3+ T cells, GATA-3 and intestinal barrier maturation, whereas decrease the Th2-mediated cytokines, IgA, IgE, IgG1, IL-4, IL-5 and IL-6, IL-13, airway reactivity, pulmonary eosinophilia. Furthermore, Clostridium butyricum could act by improvement of anaphylaxis symptoms and increase of sIgA and CD4+ CD25+FoxP3Treg cells. In this review, we assessed the recent evidence that confirms the role of probiotics compounds as an important factor in the safety of homeostasis and the development of allergic reactions through a complex set of metabolites and the immune cells.

Each human possesses a specific gut microbiota, which can be altered by diet, antibiotics, lifestyle, and genetic background. Gut microbiota perform vital functions, but in this article, we aimed to elaborate the effects of modified composition of microbiota on host metabolism. Ligands for G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are shortchain fatty acids (SCFAs) located on endocrine glands, epithelial cells, and adipocytes. SCFAs are produced in the distal gut by bacterial fermentation of nondigestible polysaccharides; they induce the various beneficial effects including decrease serum glucose level, insulin resistance, as well as inflammation; and they increase glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP1) secretion. Fasting-induced adipose factor (FIAF) is suppressed by gut microbiota and results in the increased storage of fatty acids in the adipose tissues and liver. An increased lipopolysaccharide level due to altered gut microflora cause the initiation of inflammation associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Intestinal dysbiosis and metabolic endotoxemia are considered key mechanisms that seem to be associated with the development of T2DM and obesity.

The gastrointestinal microflora provides a vast and continuous stimulation for the immune system. However, the composition and diversity of gut microflora in CU patients are rarely reported. Methods: 10 CU patients and 10 healthy individuals were selected in this study, and their intestinal microbiome was detected by 16S rRNA sequencing. The data were analyzed using R language software. Results: 392 bacterial OTUs were common in the CU and healthy groups, but there were 159 OTUs particularly existing in the CU group, while 87 OTUs only were observed in healthy individuals. The bacterial diversity was reduced in CU patients compared with healthy individuals. The principal component analysis (PCA) and principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) revealed that the bacterial cluster in CU patients and the healthy controls were divided into different branches. Pathogenic strains including Escherichia coli were significantly higher in CU, while Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Prevotella copri, and Bacteroides sp. were significantly lower in CU when compared with the healthy controls. CU patients with a high abundance of Escherichia coli had no ideal effect for probiotic therapy. Conclusion: Our results demonstrated that the microbial composition was significantly different between CU patients and the healthy individual, which may be the reason leading to the various outcomes of probiotic treatment.

Interestingly, β-1,3/1,6-glucan and/or L. plantarum LM1004 significantly decreased the mRNA levels of Th2 and Th17 cell transcription factors, while the transcription factors of Th1 and Treg cells, galactin-9, filaggrin increased, which are indicative of enhanced immunomodulation (p &lt; 0.05). Moreover, in rats with no AD induction, the same treatments significantly increased the relative abundance of phylum Bacteroidetes and the genus Bacteroides. Furthermore, bacterial taxa associated with butyrate production such as, Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae at family, and Roseburia at genus level were increased in the treated groups. These findings suggest that the dietary supplementation of β-1,3/1,6-glucan and/or L. plantarum LM1004 has a great potential for treatment of AD as well as obesity in humans through mechanisms that might involve modulation of host immune systems and gut microbiota.

In humans, LR reduces crying time in breastfed infants with colic, modifies severity in infants with acute diarrheal illnesses, and improves pain in children with functional bowel disorders. In healthy breastfed newborns with evolving microbial colonization, it is unclear if early administration of LR can modulate gut microbiota and their metabolites in such a way as to promote homeostasis. We gavaged LR (107 colony-forming units/day, daily) to C57BL/6J mice at age of day 8 for 2 wk. Both male and female mice were investigated in these experiments. We found that feeding LR did not affect clinical phenotype or inflammatory biomarkers in plasma and stool, but LR increased the proportion of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the intestine. LR also increased bacterial diversity and the relative abundance of p_Firmicutes, f_Lachnospiraceae, f_Ruminococcaceae, and genera Clostridium and Candidatus arthromitus, while decreasing the relative abundance of p_Bacteriodetes, f_Bacteroidaceae, f_Verrucomicrobiaceae, and genera Bacteroides, Ruminococcus, Akkermansia, and Sutterella. Finally, LR exerted a major impact on the plasma metabolome, upregulating amino acid metabolites formed via the urea, tricarboxylic acid, and methionine cycles and increasing tryptophan metabolism. In conclusion, early oral administration of LR to healthy breastfed mice led to microbial and metabolic changes which could be beneficial to general health.

When used as a feed additive, they have the potential to minimize or abolish the use of antibiotics. In this study, we investigated the effect of the probiotic strain Bacillus amyloliquefaciens TL on the growth performance and cecum microflora composition in Cobb 500 broiler chickens. In total, 180 broilers were randomly divided into three groups - each group comprised 4 pens, and each pen contained 15 chickens. The three groups were fed either a control diet, or a diet supplemented with either the antibiotic chlortetracycline or B. amyloliquefaciens TL. Broilers were weighed, and cecum contents were collected on days 7, 14, 21, and 35, respectively. The broilers in both the antibiotic and probiotic groups exhibited significant weight gain compared with controls, exhibiting increases of 16.02% and 13.40%, respectively, after 35 days (P<0.01). Similarly, the feed conversion ratio (FCR, 1-35 days) of broilers in the chlortetracycline and B. amyloliquefaciens TL groups was lower than that of the controls. HiSeq high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA of the cecal microbiota was performed on days 7, 14, 21, and 35, respectively. The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio was higher in the chlortetracycline and B. amyloliquefaciens TL groups than in the control group on days 14, 21, and 35, and especially on day 21. The prevalence of genera Oscillospira, Ruminococcus, Butyricicoccus, and Faecalibacterium (Firmicutes) was higher in the antibiotic and probiotic groups, while that of Bacteroides, Parabacteroides (Bacteroidetes), and Lactobacillus was higher in the control group. In this study, the changes in the microbiota of the probiotic group were similar to those in the antibiotic group. These results suggest that the probiotic strain B. amyloliquefaciens TL can modulate the cecal microbiota of broilers similar to chlortetracycline. © 2019 Yuxuan Hong et al.",12.0

Screening of cellulose degrading bacteria was carried out based on CMC (carboxyl methyl Cellulose) hydrolytic test which was seen as clear zone around colony as well as whatsman filter paper degradation test. Twenty bacterial isolates with clearance zone diameter of >10mm on CMC agar were screened out for filter paper degradation test. Out of twenty isolates, only eight were able to digest filter paper and subjected to cellulase enzyme assay, microbiological analysis and molecular characterization. Cellulase enzyme was extracted from each isolate and enzyme activity assay was performed based on 3-5, dinitro- salcylic acid (DNS) method. Enzyme activity ranged from 0.225u/ml to 1.652u/ml in which maximum result was obtained in bacterial isolate labelled as KLCD08. Bacteriological study of the isolates showed that five isolates (KLCD04, KLCD012, KLCD15, KLCD18, KLCD19) belong to Bacillus species, two isolates (KLCD01, KLCD09.) Bacteriodes species and one isolate (KLCD08) Enterobacter pecies. Molecular characterization was applied to the isolate with greater cellulolytic activity (KLCD08) based on 16srRNA gene sequencing. According to phylogenetic analysis made by the use of EZBIocloud database, the isolate showed 99.84 % homology with Enterobacter cloacae subsp. Dissolvens. The sequence was deposited to NCBI GenBank with accession number of MN120893. The identified bacteria could be used for large scale production of cellulase enzyme through bio-processing technology.

In this study, an effective strategy for discovering high-efficiency probiotics has been developed. First, in order to survive in the conditions of the stomach and intestine, high bile salt-resistant and strong acid-resistant strains were screened out from the fecal flora of healthy adults. Next, the probiotic candidates were rescreened by examining the induction ability of IL-10 (anti-inflammatory factor) production in dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis mice, and Lactobacillus sakei 07 (L07) was identified and selected as probiotic P. In the end, fourteen bifidobacterium strains isolated from stools of healthy males were examined for their antimicrobial activity. Bifidobacterium bifidum B10 (73.75% inhibition rate) was selected as probiotic B. Moreover, the colonic IL-6 and TNF-α expression of the DSS-induced colitis mice treated with L. sakei 07 (L07) – B. bifidum B10 combination (PB) significantly decreased and the IL-10 expression was up-regulated by PB compared to the DSS group. Furthermore, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria decreased and Firmicutes increased in the DSS group mice, significantly. More interestingly, the intestinal flora biodiversity of DSS colitis mice was increased by PB. Of those, the level of B. bifidum increased significantly. The Bacteriodetes/Firmicutes (B/F) ratio increased, and the concentration of homocysteine and LPS in plasma was down-regulated by PB in the DSS-induced colitis mice. Upon administration of PB, the intestinal permeability of the the DSS-induced colitis mice was decreased by approximately 2.01-fold. This method is expected to be used in high-throughput screening of the probiotics against colitis. In addition, the L. sakei 07 – B. bifidum B10 combination holds potential in UC remission by immunomodulatory and gut microbiota modulation.

The gut microbiota is considered as a factor involved in the regulation of numerous metabolic pathways by impacting several functions of the host. It has been suggested that probiotics can modulate host gene expression and metabolism, and thereby positively influence host adipose tissue development and obesity related-metabolic disorders. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the effect of an exopolysaccharide (EPS)-producing Bifidobacterium strain on host glucose and lipid metabolism and the gut microbial composition in a short-term diet-induced obesity (DIO) in mice. C57BL/6J male mice were randomly divided into three groups: a control group that received control standard diet, a group fed a high-fat diet (HF), and a group fed HF supplemented with Bifidobacterium animalis IPLA R1. Fasting serum insulin as well as triglycerides accumulation in the liver were significantly reduced in the group receiving B. animalis IPLA R1. The treatment with the EPS-producing B. animalis IPLA R1 tended to down-regulate the expression of host genes involved in the hepatic synthesis of fatty acids which was concomitant with an upregulation in the expression of genes related with fatty acid oxidation. B. animalis IPLA R1 not only promoted the increase of Bifidobacterium but also the levels of Bacteroides-Prevotella. Our data indicate that the EPS-producing Bifidobacterium IPLA R1 strain may have beneficial effects in metabolic disorders associated with obesity, by modulating the gut microbiota composition and promoting changes in lipids metabolism and glucose homeostasis. © 2019 Salazar, Neyrinck, Bindels, Druart, Ruas-Madiedo, Cani, de los Reyes-Gavilán and Delzenne.",12.0

Materials and Methods: A total of 40 patients with IBD (19 control group and 21 observation group) were randomized. Patients in the control group were given pentasa, and patients in the observation group were given probiotics along with pentasa. The microflora composition, biochemical indices, inflammatory markers, and activity scores of the two groups were analyzed. Results: After treatment, the number of enterobacteria, enterococci, saccharomyces, and bacteroides; the levels of fecal lactoferrin, 1-antitrypsin, â2-microglobulin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and interleukin (IL)-6; activity scores; and recurrence rate in the observation group were significantly lower than those in the control group. Bifidobacterium and lactobacillus counts and IL-4 levels were significantly higher in the observation group than in the control group. Conclusion: The combination of probiotics and pentasa can improve microflora composition in patients with IBD and reduce the level of inflammatory cytokines; therefore, it is worthy of further clinical validation. © 2019 AVES.

Several randomized prospective clinical trials demonstrated that oral probiotics could decrease the incidence of NEC. Previously, we isolated and characterized a novel probiotic, Bacteroides fragilis strain ZY-312. However, it remains unclear how ZY-312 protects the host from the effects of C. sakazakii infection. To understand the underlying mechanisms triggering the probiotic effects, we tested the hypothesis that there was cross talk between probiotics/probiotics-modulated microbiota and the local immune system, governed by the permeability of the intestinal mucosa, using in vitro and in vivo models for the intestinal permeability. The probiotic effects of ZY- 312 on intestinal epithelial cells were first examined, and the results revealed that ZY-312 inhibited C. sakazakii invasion, C. sakazakii-induced dual cell death (pyroptosis and apoptosis), and epithelial barrier dysfunction in vitro and in vivo. The presence of ZY-312 also resulted in decreased expression of an inflammasome (NOD-like receptor family member pyrin domain-containing protein 3 [NLRP3]), caspase-3, and serine protease caspase-1 in a neonatal rat model. Furthermore, ZY-312 significantly modulated the compositions of the intestinal bacterial communities and decreased the relative abundances of Proteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria but increased the relative abundances of Bacteroides and Bacillus in neonatal rats. In conclusion, our findings have shown for the first time that the probiotic B. fragilis ZY-312 suppresses C. sakazakii-induced NEC by modulating the proinflammatory response and dual cell death (apoptosis and pyroptosis). IMPORTANCE Cronobacter sakazakii is an opportunistic pathogenic bacterium that can cause necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). However, the mechanism of pathogenicity of C. sakazakii is largely unknown. Here we have now demonstrated that apoptotic and pyroptotic stimuli are effectors of C. sakazakii-induced NEC. Previously, we isolated a novel probiotic strain candidate from fecal samples from healthy infants and characterized it as Bacteroides fragilis strain ZY-312. Functional characterization reveals that ZY-312 inhibited C. sakazakii invasion, restoring epithelial barrier dysfunction, decreasing the expression of inflammatory cytokines, and reducing dual cell death (pyroptosis and apoptosis). Furthermore, the presence of ZY-132 was sufficient to hinder the adverse reaction seen with C. sakazakii in a C. sakazakii-induced NEC model. Taking the results together, our study demonstrated the utility of ZY-312 as a promising probiotic agent for the prevention of NEC. Copyright © 2019 Fan et al.",25.0

Buchta Rosean and colleagues present the first functional evidence that a preexisting disturbance in the gut microbiome leads to increased breast cancer cell metastasis in a mouse model. This discovery places the gut microbiome as a new player in breast cancer metastasis; however, further studies are required to determine the relevance of the findings in this mouse model to human disease.

Efforts at searching for links with the gut microbiome have revealed that propionate is a major fermentation product in the gut with several health benefits toward energy homeostasis. For instance, propionate stimulates satiety-inducing hormones, leading to lower energy intake and reducing weight gain and associated risk factors. In (disease) scenarios where microbial dysbiosis is apparent, gut microbial production of propionate may be decreased. Here, we investigated the effect of a propionogenic bacterial consortium composed of Lactobacillus plantarum, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Ruminococcus obeum, Coprococcus catus, Bacteroides vulgatus, Akkermansia muciniphila, and Veillonella parvula for its potential to restore in vitro propionate concentrations upon antibiotic-induced microbial dysbiosis. Using the mucosal simulator of the human intestinal microbial ecosystem (M-SHIME), we challenged the simulated colon microbiome with clindamycin. Addition of the propionogenic consortium resulted in successful colonization and subsequent restoration of propionate levels, while a positive effect on the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) was observed in comparison with the controls. Our results support the development and application of next generation probiotics, which are composed of multiple bacterial strains with diverse functionality and phylogenetic background.

Modern lifestyle changes include hygienic practices, food preparation and eradication of many contagious diseases. In this context, probiotic microorganisms are biocontrol remedies still under development, solving a number of gastrointestinal and immunological issues, while fighting hazardous microbiological biofilms on different surfaces. Probiotics are mainly associated with Lactic Acid Bacteria, however environmental, non-dairy sources are promising ecological niches of probiotic spore-forming Bacillus species. Industrial applications of these ""unconventional"" probiotics take an advantage of their sporulating activity which greatly enhances their compatibility with chemical formulations used in the household, cosmetic or pharmaceutical chemistry. We have analysed 14 commercially available chemical products, labelled or described to contain a probiotic or biologically active component. It was determined that in the most part they relay on consortiums of spore-forming, very closely related Bacillus species, exhibiting bimodal existence in the environment and the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). In addition, we have found a number of non-sporulating species. Overall, the microorganisms found included: Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus pumilus, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella oxytoca, Stenotrophomonas malthophila, Serratia liquefaciens, Bacillus altitudinis, Lactobacillus gastricus, Bacillus megaterium, Lactobacillus nagelii, Aromatoleum buckelii, Trichosporon mucoides, Clostridium novyi, Bacteroides uniformis. As some of the listed species may become opportunistic pathogens, this raises an important question concerning general safety of probiotics, as apparently the manufacturing procedures do not always lead to microbiologically defined or sufficiently controlled microorganism consortiums. © 2019, Acta Biochimica Polonica.",4.0

However, ICB immunotherapy also triggers severe inflammatory side effects, known as immune-related adverse effects (irAEs). One of the most common toxicities is immune checkpoint blockade-associated colitis (ICB associated colitis). The exact mechanism of ICB associated colitis remains to be explored. Here, we combined ICB (anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1) treatment with a standard colitis model, in which a more severe form of colitis is induced in mice, to recapitulate the clinical observations in patients receiving combined ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4) and nivolumab (anti-PD-1) therapy, during which colitis is the most frequent complication encountered. We found that the composition of the gut microbiota changed in ICB associated colitis. Principal component analysis of the gut microbiome showed an obvious reduction in the abundance of Lactobacillus in severe ICB associated colitis. Lactobacillus depletion completely by vancomycin augmented the immunopathology of ICB. Furthermore, we found that the ICB toxicity could be totally eliminated via the administration of a widely available probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri (L.reuteri). Oral administration of L. reuteri therapeutically inhibited the development and progression of colitis, thus ameliorating the loss of body weight and inflammatory status induced by ICB treatment. Mechanistically, the protective effect of L. reuteri was associated with a decrease in the distribution of group 3 innate lymphocytes (ILC3s) induced by ICB associated colitis. In conclusion, our study highlights the immunomodulatory mechanism of the gut microbiota and suggests that manipulating the gut microbiota by administrating L. reuteri can mitigate the autoimmunity induced by ICB, thus allowing ICB immunotherapy to stimulate the desired immune response without an apparent immunopathology. © 2019 Wang, Zheng, Luo, Jiang, He, Yuan and Shen.",39.0

Therefore, people consume dietary products containing traditional probiotics in wishing to improve their health, and they need more research-based advices on how to select products with suitable probiotic species. Probiotic designers are sometimes confused about how to design precision products for different consumers by taking advantages of different probiotic species' strengths. Additionally, large-scale analyses on traditional probiotic complementarity potentials and their roles in gut microbiome related to common diseases are not well understood. Here, we comprehensively analyzed 444 genomes of major traditional probiotic (sub) species (MTPS, n = 15) by combining one newly sequenced genome with all of the public NCBI-available MTPS-related genomes.

Additionally, the introduction of defined bacterial species into the mouse intestinal microbiota has been shown to impact on the adaptive immune response. However, how much impact the intestinal microbiota composition actually has on regulating adaptive immunity remains poorly understood. Therefore, we studied aspects of the adaptive immunity in healthy adults possessing distinct intestinal microbiota profiles. The intestinal microbiota composition was determined via Illumina sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes extracted from the feces of 35 individuals. Blood B-cell and T-cell subsets from the same individuals were studied using flow cytometry. Finally, the binding of fecal and plasma Immunoglobulin A (IgA) to intestinal bacteria (associated with health and disease) Bacteroides fragilis, Prevotella copri, Bifidobacterium longum, Clostridium difficile, and Escherichia coli was analyzed using ELISA. Unsupervised clustering of microbiota composition revealed the presence of three clusters within the cohort. Cluster 1 and 2 were similar to previously-described enterotypes with a predominance of Bacteroides in Cluster 1 and Prevotella in Cluster 2. The bacterial diversity (Shannon index) and bacterial richness of Cluster 3 was significantly higher than observed in Clusters 1 and 2, with the Ruminococacceae tending to predominate. Within circulating B- and T-cell subsets, only Th subsets were significantly different between groups of distinct intestinal microbiota. Individuals of Cluster 3 have significantly fewer Th17 and Th22 circulating cells, while Th17.1 cell numbers were increased in individuals of Cluster 1. IgA reactivity to intestinal bacteria was higher in plasma than feces, and individuals of Cluster 1 had significant higher plasma IgA reactivity against B. longum than individuals of Cluster 2. In conclusion, we identified three distinct fecal microbiota clusters, of which two clusters resembled previously-described “enterotypes”. Global T-cell and B-cell immunity seemed unaffected, however, circulating Th subsets and plasma IgA reactivity were significantly different between Clusters. Hence, the impact of intestinal bacteria composition on human B cells, T cells and IgA reactivity appears limited in genetically-diverse and environmentally-exposed humans, but can skew antibody reactivity and Th cell subsets. © 2019 Grosserichter-Wagener, Radjabzadeh, van der Weide, Smit, Kraaij, Hays and van Zelm.

Methods: Sixty healthy male BALB/c mice were selected and divided into the allergic model group (n=15), low dosage treatment group (n=15), high dosage treatment group (n=15) and the control group (n=15) using random number methods. The allergy model group was given an intraperitoneal injection of 1 mg aluminum solution and 10μg OVA normal saline, and a food allergy model was established. Mice in the low dosage treatment group were given intra-gastric administration of lactate Bifidobacterium AD011 and Lactobacillus acidophilus AD031 within one hour after the establishment of the food allergy model (each 1×108 CFU/mL, 100μL/d). In the high dosage treatment group, mice models were formed according to the above methods and given an intra-gastric administration of lactate Bifidobacterium AD011 and Lactobacillus acidophilus AD031 within one hour (each 1×109 CFU/mL, 100μL/d). The control group was given an intra-gastric administration of normal saline equal to the volume of that of the allergy model group. Allergic symptoms, microstructure of the intestinal tissue, spleen, thymus gland tissue, body mass, levels of IgE, IL-4 and IFN-γ, and Escherichia coli and Bacteroides levels were observed in the various groups. Results: Allergy symptom scores, IL-4 level, and Escherichia coli and Bacteroides levels in the allergic mice model were obviously higher than those of the control group and the treatment group, with statistical significance (P<0.05); allergy symptom scores, IL-4 level, and Escherichia coli level in the high dosage group were obviously lower than those of the low dosage group, with statistical significance (P<0.05). The body mass, IgE level, ratio of IFN-γ/IL-4 and IFN-γ level in the allergic mice model group were obviously lower than those of the control group and the treatment group, with statistical significance (P<0.05). The IgE level, ratio of IFN-γ/ IL-4 and IFN-γ levels in the high dosage group were obviously higher than those of the low dosage treatment group, with statistical significance (P<0.05). The differences between thymus index and spleen index of mice in four groups showed no statistical significance (P>0.05); the intestinal mucous membrane of mice in the control group and the treatment group was intact. Small intestinal cells had a close arrangement; the intestinal mucous membrane of mice in the allergic mice model was necrotic. Some epithelial cells showed edema and even necrosis. Conclusion: Lactate Bifidobacterium AD011 and Lactobacillus acidophilus AD031 can improve allergic symptoms in mice with food allergy induced by OVA, relieve inflammation of small intestinal tissue, increase body mass and serum IgE and IFN-γ levels, and lower IL-4, Escherichia coli and Bacteroides levels. © 2019 A.

The component of COS was measured by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). CHD patients were evenly assigned into the COS group (COG) and the placebo group (CG). The duration of treatment was 6 months and therapeutic results were explored by measuring left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) value, Lee scores, quality of life (QOL), blood urea nitrogen, and serum creatinine. The intestinal flora were determined by 16s rDNA sequencing. The circulating antioxidant levels and lipid profiles were compared between two groups. There were 7 different degrees of polymerization (DP4-10) in COS. Lee scores, QOL scores, and LVEF values in the COG group were higher than those in the CG group (P<0.05). COS treatment improved blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine when compared with controls (P<0.05). Circulating antioxidant levels were higher in the COG group than in the CG group. COS consumption increased the serum levels of SOD and GSH and reduced the levels of ALT and AST (P<0.05). Meanwhile, lipid profiles were improved in the COG group. COS consumption increased the abundance of Faecalibacterium, Alistipes, and Escherichia and decreased the abundance of Bacteroides, Megasphaera, Roseburia, Prevotella, and Bifidobacterium (P<0.05). On the other hand, COS consumption increased the probiotic species Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, and Phascolarctobacterium. The increased species have been reported to be associated with antioxidant properties or lipid improvement. COS had similar effects with chitohexaose on the growth rate of these species. Therefore, COS ameliorate the symptoms of CHD patients by improving antioxidant capacities and lipid profiles via the increase of probiotics in the intestinal flora. © 2019 Tiechao Jiang et al.",15.0

The gut microbiota contains a large proportion of probiotic commensal Lactobacillus species; some natural microbiota and probiotics confer protection against IBD. In this study, mice with colitis triggered by dextran sodium sulphate (DSS) were given Lactobacillus plantarum orally. We assessed the damage caused by DSS and the therapeutic activity of L. plantarum. The colitis triggered by DSS was less severe in the mice that received the L. plantarum treatment, which also diversified the microbe species in the colon, enhanced the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes, and diminished the relative abundance of Lactobacillus. The taxonomic units of greatest diversity in the DSS and L. plantarum groups were identified using a linear discriminant and effect size (LEfSe) analysis. Aliihoeflea was established to be the genus of bacteria that was affected in the L. plantarum group most extensively. In conclusion, gut health was promoted by L. plantarum, as it diversified the microbes in the colon and restricted the activity of pathogenic bacteria in the intestine. Moreover, according to the LEfSe analysis, the DSS group was impacted more significantly by gut microorganisms than the L. plantarum group, suggesting that L. plantarum improved the stability of the intestinal tract. © 2019 Fei Zhang et al.",31.0

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and probiotic intervention have been shown to be promising approaches for reducing the colonization of certain pathogenic bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract, however, no such studies have been done on VRE. In this study, we evaluated the effect of FMT and two Lactobacillus strains (Y74 and HT121) on the colonization of VRE in a VRE-infection mouse model. We found that both Lactobacilli strains reduced VRE colonization rapidly. Fecal microbiota and colon mRNA expression analyses further showed that mice in FMT and the two Lactobacilli treatment groups restored their intestinal microbiota diversity faster than those in the phosphate buffer saline (PBS) treated group. Administration of Lactobacilli restored Firmicutes more quickly to the normal level, compared to FMT or PBS treatment, but restored Bacteroides to their normal level less quickly than FMT did. Furthermore, these treatments also had an impact on the relative abundance of intestinal microbiota composition from phylum to species level. RNA-seq showed that FMT treatment induced the expression of more genes in the colon, compared to the Lactobacilli treatment. Defense-related genes such as defensin α, Apoa1, and RegIII were down-regulated in both FMT and the two Lactobacilli treatment groups. Taken together, our findings indicate that both FMT and Lactobacilli treatments were effective in decreasing the colonization of VRE in the gut. © 2007 - 2019 Frontiers Media S.A.

Methods: Sixty healthy male BALB/c mice were selected and divided into the allergic model group (n=15), low dosage treatment group (n=15), high dosage treatment group (n=15) and the control group (n=15) using random number methods. The allergy model group was given an intraperitoneal injection of 1 mg aluminum solution and 10μg OVA normal saline, and a food allergy model was established. Mice in the low dosage treatment group were given intra-gastric administration of lactate Bifidobacterium AD011 and Lactobacillus acidophilus AD031 within one hour after the establishment of the food allergy model (each 1×108 CFU/mL, 100μL/d). In the high dosage treatment group, mice models were formed according to the above methods and given an intra-gastric administration of lactate Bifidobacterium AD011 and Lactobacillus acidophilus AD031 within one hour (each 1×109 CFU/mL, 100μL/d). The control group was given an intra-gastric administration of normal saline equal to the volume of that of the allergy model group. Allergic symptoms, microstructure of the intestinal tissue, spleen, thymus gland tissue, body mass, levels of IgE, IL-4 and IFN-γ, and Escherichia coli and Bacteroides levels were observed in the various groups. Results: Allergy symptom scores, IL-4 level, and Escherichia coli and Bacteroides levels in the allergic mice model were obviously higher than those of the control group and the treatment group, with statistical significance (P<0.05); allergy symptom scores, IL-4 level, and Escherichia coli level in the high dosage group were obviously lower than those of the low dosage group, with statistical significance (P<0.05). The body mass, IgE level, ratio of IFN-γ/IL-4 and IFN-γ level in the allergic mice model group were obviously lower than those of the control group and the treatment group, with statistical significance (P<0.05). The IgE level, ratio of IFN-γ/IL-4 and IFN-γ levels in the high dosage group were obviously higher than those of the low dosage treatment group, with statistical significance (P<0.05). The differences between thymus index and spleen index of mice in four groups showed no statistical significance (P>0.05); the intestinal mucous membrane of mice in the control group and the treatment group was intact. Small intestinal cells had a close arrangement; the intestinal mucous membrane of mice in the allergic mice model was necrotic. Some epithelial cells showed edema and even necrosis. Conclusion: Lactate Bifidobacterium AD011 and Lactobacillus acidophilus AD031 can improve allergic symptoms in mice with food allergy induced by OVA, relieve inflammation of small intestinal tissue, increase body mass and serum IgE and IFN-γ levels, and lower IL-4, Escherichia coli and Bacteroides levels. © 2019 A.

The severity of these symptoms has been correlated with the degree of GI microbial dysbiosis. The study objective was to assess tolerability of a probiotic (Bifidobacterium infantis) in combination with a bovine colostrum product (BCP) as a source of prebiotic oligosaccharides and to evaluate GI, microbiome and immune factors in children with ASD and GI co-morbidities. This pilot study is a randomized, double blind, controlled trial of combination treatment (BCP + B. infantis) vs. BCP alone in a cross-over study in children ages 2-11 with ASD and GI co-morbidities (n = 8). This 12-week study included 5 weeks of probiotic-prebiotic supplementation, followed by a two-week washout period, and 5 weeks of prebiotic only supplementation. The primary outcome of tolerability was assessed using validated questionnaires of GI function and atypical behaviors, along with side effects. Results suggest that the combination treatment is well-tolerated in this cohort. The most common side effect was mild gassiness. Some participants on both treatments saw a reduction in the frequency of certain GI symptoms, as well as reduced occurrence of particular aberrant behaviors. Improvement may be explained by a reduction in IL-13 and TNF-α production in some participants. Although limited conclusions can be drawn from this small pilot study, the results support the need for further research into the efficacy of these treatments. © 2018 Selvaggio, Pearlstein.

In the present study, a probiotic combination containing Bifidobacterium infantis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Enterococcus faecalis and Bacillus cereus was used to reduce the physiological disorders induced by gastrectomy via monitoring the blood index and microbial diversity using high-throughput sequencing. Our results indicated that the probiotic combination had significantly reduced the inflammation indexes (leukocyte) (p<0.05), while it markedly enhanced the immunity indexes (lymphocyte) and nutrition indexes (albumin and total protein) (p<0.05). In addition, gastric cancer had a strong influence on the microbial diversity of the stomach via enhancing the number of pathogens of Streptococcus, Peptostreptococcus and Prevotella, and reducing the percentage of the probiotic Bifidobacterium. Although partial gastrectomy markedly changed intestinal microbial diversity, the taking of the probiotic combination greatly reduced the ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes compared with patients taking no probiotics at the phylum level. At the genus level, the probiotic combination significantly enhanced the numbers of the probiotic bacteria Bacteroides, Faecalibacterium and Akkermansia and lowered the richness of Streptococcus. Therefore, we concluded that the taking of the probiotic combination significantly enhances the immune response of patients and reduces the severity of inflammation through modification of gut microbiota. © 2019 Ivyspring International Publisher.",28.0

Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron is a prominent human colon commensal bacterial species that hydrolyzes GOS using an extracellular Glycosyl Hydrolase (GH) family GH53 endo-galactanase enzyme (BTGH53), releasing galactose-based products for growth. Here we dissect the molecular basis for GOS activity of this B. thetaiotaomicron GH53 endo-galactanase. Elucidation of its X-ray crystal structure revealed that BTGH53 has a relatively open active site cleft which was not observed with the bacterial enzyme from Bacillus licheniformis (BLGAL). BTGH53 acted on GOS with degree of polymerization ≤3 and therefore more closely resembles activity of fungal GH53 enzymes (e.g. Aspergillus aculeatus AAGAL and Meripileus giganteus MGGAL). Probiotic lactobacilli that lack galactan utilization systems constitute a group of bacteria with relevance for a healthy (infant) gut. The strains tested were unable to use GOS ≥ DP3. However, they completely consumed GOS in the presence of BTGH53, resulting in clear stimulation of their extent of growth. The extracellular BTGH53 enzyme thus may play an important role in carbohydrate metabolism in complex microbial environments such as the human colon. It also may find application for the development of synergistic synbiotics. © 2018 The Authors",9.0

We conducted a large-scale study to examine the gut microbiota of different traditional rural and urban lifestyles in human populations. Using high-throughput 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing, we tested urban French, Saudi, Senegalese, Nigerian and Polynesian individuals as well as individuals living in traditional rural societies, including Amazonians from French Guiana, Congolese Pygmies, Saudi Bedouins and Algerian Tuaregs. The gut microbiota from individuals living in traditional rural settings clustered differently and presented significantly higher diversity than those of urban populations (p 0.01). The bacterial taxa identified by class analysis as contributing most significantly to each cluster were Phascolarctobacterium for traditional rural individuals and Bifidobacterium for urban individuals. Spirochaetae were only present in the gut microbiota of individuals from traditional rural societies, and the gut microbiota of all traditional rural populations was enriched with Treponema succinifaciens. Cross-transmission of Treponema from termites or swine to humans or the increased use of antibiotics in nontraditional populations may explain why Treponema is present only in the gut microbiota of traditional rural populations. © 2018",32.0

Gut microbiota plays an important role in enterohepatic circulation, which in turn plays an important role in the secretion of bilirubin. We aimed to determine the composition of gut microbiota in patients with NC and BMJ, and to identify the gut microbiota composition associated with NC and BMJ. Methods: Data on age, gender, delivery, feeding mode, serum total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, and liver function were collected for NC patients, BMJ patients and healthy controls, respectively. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing and metagenome-wide association were performed. Results: Forty NC patients, 16 patients affected by BMJ, and 14 healthy controls (CON) without jaundice were enrolled. A significant increase in species richness, especially Bacteroides, was found in NC patients. The abundances of potentially pathogenic species and KEGG orthologies (KOs) of virulence factor genes were positively correlated with serum bilirubin level. The abundances of nine species of Bifidobacterium and three KOs of galactose metabolism were significantly decreased in the jaundice group (NC and BMJ) and were negatively correlated with serum bilirubin level. Conclusions: The gut microbiota in NC patients is characterized by a significant increase in species richness, possibly due to the proliferation of potentially pathogenic species. Additionally, the gut microbiota in jaundice patients is characterized by a decreased abundance of Bifidobacterium. Decreased Bifidobacterium has been associated with elevated bilirubin and abnormal gut microbiota galactose metabolic pathway. Further, ten bacteria species were identified as potential biomarker of jaundice. Key points: Question Is there any alteration of gut microbiotain neonatal cholestasis patients? Does gut microbiota have any involvement in the occurrence of neonatal cholestasis or breast milk jaundice? Findings The alteration of gut microbiota in neonatal cholestasis patients mainly manifested as a significant increase in species richness and an increased abundance of potentially pathogenic species, while the main manifestation in jaundice patients was a significant decrease in Bifidobacterium which may be involved in the metabolism of bilirubin through the galactose metabolic pathway. Meaning The results suggest that an imbalance of gut microbiota exist in neonatal cholestasis and breast milk jaundice patients, primarily in the form of a substantial reduction in the abundance of Bifidobacterium, suggesting the possibility of intervention treatment for neonatal cholestasis and breast milk jaundice by supplementing probiotics. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",17.0

Contrastingly, enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF) is highly associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colorectal cancer (CRC), rapidly inducing IL-17-dependent murine colitis and tumorigenesis. In specific-pathogen-free (SPF) C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) and multiple intestinal neoplasia (Min Apc716+/− ) mice, we show that sequential treatment of the NTBF strain, 9343, followed by the ETBF strain, 86-5443-2-2 (86), diminished colitis and tumorigenesis. Mice treated simultaneously with 9343 and 86 exhibited both severe colitis and tumorigenesis. Abrogated disease severity in sequentially treated mice was attributed to 9343 strain dominance and decreased IL-17A, but 86 colonization prior to or simultaneous with 9343 mitigated the anti-inflammatory effect of 9343. Remarkably, 9343-mediated protection was independent of PSA, as sequentially treated mice receiving ΔPSA 9343 exhibited similar protection. Further, SPF WT and Min mice colonized with PSA-competent or PSA-deficient 9343 exhibited similar IL-10, IL-17, and IFN-γ responses. Treatment of 86-colonized mice with 9343 failed to disrupt 86 pathogenesis. Our findings demonstrate that 9343 colonization, independent of PSA, offers prophylaxis against colitis-inducing 86 but may not be a valid therapy once colitis is established. © 2018, Society for Mucosal Immunology.",28.0

The aetiology of this condition remains unknown; however, it has been previously suggested that enteric dysbiosis is implicated in the pathogenesis of CFS/ME. This review examines the evidence currently available for the presence of abnormal microbial ecology in CFS/ME in comparison to healthy controls, with one exception being probiotic-supplemented CFS/ME patients, and whether the composition of the microbiome plays a role in symptom causation. Methods: EMBASE, Medline (via EBSCOhost), Pubmed and Scopus were systematically searched from 1994 to March 2018. All studies that investigated the gut microbiome composition of CFS/ME patients were initially included prior to the application of specific exclusion criteria. The association between these findings and patient-centred outcomes (fatigue, quality of life, gastrointestinal symptoms, psychological wellbeing) are also reported. Results: Seven studies that met the inclusion criteria were included in the review. The microbiome composition of CFS/ME patients was compared with healthy controls, with the exception of one study that compared to probiotic-supplemented CFS/ME patients. Differences were reported in each study; however, only three were considered statistically significant, and the findings across all studies were inconsistent. The quality of the studies included in this review scored between poor (< 54%), fair (54-72%) and good (94-100%) using the Downs and Black checklist. Conclusions: There is currently insufficient evidence for enteric dysbiosis playing a significant role in the pathomechanism of CFS/ME. Recommendations for future research in this field include the use of consistent criteria for the diagnosis of CFS/ME, reduction of confounding variables by controlling factors that influence microbiome composition prior to sample collection and including more severe cases of CFS/ME. © 2018 The Author(s).",18.0

The intestinal microbiome is made up of a diverse group of microorganisms, including bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes, living together intimately. There are 300 to 1,000 different species living in the colon, which contains a densely-populated microbial ecosystem (Knight and Girling, 2003; Sears, 2005). However, 99% of the bacteria come from about 30 or 40 species (Knight and Girling, 2003; Sears, 2005). The human gastrointestinal microbiome plays an essential role in protecting the intestine, promoting nutrient absorption, resisting infection, and promoting the development of the immune system (Clarke et al., 2014). Gut microbiota can metabolize some xenobiotics such as phytochemicals, food toxicants, and drugs. The intestine-brain axis is a biochemical signaling pathway that includes the gut microbiota, central nervous system, and the neuroendocrine and neuroimmune systems. The gut microbiota can be considered as a large endocrine organ with the potential to produce nearly 100 kinds of products, which are absorbed into the blood and act on the distal organ. In the human body, the relationship between various microorganisms is mutually restricted, and the growth and decline of any one kind of microorganism may cause human diseases. There is ample evidence that complex metabolism and biochemical activities of intestinal microbiota are complementary with human physiology (Hooper et al., 2002; Turnbaugh et al., 2009; Qin et al., 2010). The gut microbiota operates as a whole and has a close relationship with human health and diseases (Qin et al., 2010). The intestinal microbiota has wide participation in cometabolism with the body and has remarkable influence on the metabolic phenotype of the host (Qin et al., 2012; Wei et al., 2016b). The liver is an important metabolic organ in the human body and has multiple functions, such as detoxication, secretory protein synthesis, glycogen storage, and so on. The liver has an intimate relationship with the gut through the physiological structure of the gut-liver axis (Szabo, 2015). The pathological mark of liver cirrhosis is hepatic fibrosis and portal hypertension, resulting in gastrointestinal congestion, tissue edema, slow gastric peristalsis, and intestinal permeability increase. Meanwhile, impaired liver function leads to the weakened ability to scavenge metabolites and decreased defense ability in patients; the combined effect of multiple factors leads to intestinal microenvironment imbalance and dysfunction. Many studies have shown that the intestinal microbiota community associated with cirrhosis is disordered, with a marked loss of Bacteroides and significant increases in Veillonella, Enterobacteriaceae, and Streptococcus. In addition, a distinct enhancement was detected in gut microbiota genes involved in material transport and metabolism, whereas a significant loss of cell cycle-related genes was detected in cirrhosis patients (Chen et al., 2011; Wei et al., 2013; Qin et al., 2014). During disease development, the intestinal microbiota is constantly adjusting itself and regulating the body's metabolism. For a biological organism, most of the functional proteins are classified as carbohydrate metabolism and amino acid metabolism pathways, and changes in some low-abundance proteins (such as cell communication, cell motility) are usually not so significant and are not easily detected.

"Al-Bayati L., Fasaei B.N., Merat S., Bahonar A.",Longitudinal analyses of Gut-associated bacterial microbiota in ulcerative colitis patients,2018,Archives of Iranian Medicine,,"Background: The normal colonic microbiota is associated with the etiology of ulcerative colitis (UC). Several bacterial species are associated with the initiation and amplification of disease process. However, the etiology and mechanism of UC are poorly understood. The present study aimed to investigate, characterize, and compare the main composition of the mucosa-associated intestinal microflora in colonoscopic biopsy specimens of UC and non-UC patients. Methods: Aerobic and facultative-anaerobic mucosa-associated bacteria were isolated and diagnosed from colonoscopic biopsy specimens of 40 UC patients and 40 patients without UC. Patients were selected as control from the same centers and colonoscopy was carried out for other reasons (mainly colorectal screening). Isolation and characterization for aerobic and facultative-anaerobic intestinal bacteria were carried out by conventional culture techniques. DNA extraction from biopsies and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of bacterial 16S rRNA with gene-targeted and species-specific primers was performed for detection of anaerobic bacterial species. Results: Several species of mucosa-associated aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria were found in biopsy specimens and there were no significant differences between UC patients and non-UC patients. Our investigation for detection of the anaerobic intestinal flora showed Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Prevotella, and Peptostreptococcus productus were the predominant microflora in controls and have significant differences (P = 0.002, 0.025 and 0.039, respectively). Conclusion: This is the first investigation of the intestinal mucosa-associated microflora in patients with UC in Iran. These results, although limited by sample size, allow a better understanding of changes in mucosa-associated bacterial flora in these patients, showing that decrease of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Provetella, and Peptostreptococcus productus in the intestinal tract may translate into a reduction in the important role of this beneficial bacterial species, which can lead to reduced protection of the gut mucosa and UC development. © 2018 The Author(s).",8.0

In this study, we aimed to investigate the association between gut microbiota and the DNA methylation of adiponectin (an adipocyte-specific adipocytokine) in rats, following diet-induced NAFLD. Methods: 50 male SD rats were randomly divided into five groups with or without a high fat diet (HFD), antibiotics, and probiotics, in order to establish an imbalanced gut microbiota and probiotic treatment model in NAFLD rats. After 13 weeks of treatment, blood, liver, and cecal tissue samples were collected. Serum lipids, liver function indexes by biochemical analyzers, and changes in liver pathology with hematoxylin-eosin (HE) and masson staining were detected. Furthermore, the serum adiponectin by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and liver adiponectin methylation levels in the promoter regions by pyrophosphate sequencing were determined. High throughput Illumina sequencing targeted microbial 16S genes, bioinformatics and statistical analysis identified cecal-associated gut microbiota. Results: HFD with antibiotic exposure showed the most severe steatohepatitis and a severe gut microbiota alteration. Reduced bacterial diversity was also seen and the abundances of Firmicutes, Lactobacillus, Cyanobacteria, Acidobacteria, Chlamydiae, Chlamydiales, Rubrobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Blautia, Shewanella, Bacteroides, Bacteroides acidifaciens, and Bacteroides uniformis, were shown to be partly reversed by probiotic treatment. Decreased serum adiponectin levels and increased DNA methylation levels of adiponectin promoter regions were also markedly associated with the NAFLD progression during gut microbiota alteration. Conclusion: Our results suggested that both gut microbiota alteration and adiponectin variability may be drivers of NAFLD progression and that targeting the gut microbiota, such as via administration of a probiotic, may delay NAFLD progression via adiponectin. © 2018 The Author(s).

Bacteroides species make up a significant fraction of the human gut microbiome, and can be probiotic and pathogenic, depending upon various genetic and environmental factors. These can cause disease conditions such as intra-abdominal sepsis, appendicitis, bacteremia, endocarditis, pericarditis, skin infections, brain abscesses and meningitis. In this study, we identify the transport systems and predict their substrates within seven Bacteroides species, all shown to be probiotic; however, four of them (B. thetaiotaomicron, B. vulgatus, B. ovatus, B. fragilis) can be pathogenic (probiotic and pathogenic; PAP), while B. cellulosilyticus, B. salanitronis and B. dorei are believed to play only probiotic roles (only probiotic; OP). The transport system characteristics of the four PAP and three OP strains were identified and tabulated, and results were compared among the seven strains, and with E. coli and Salmonella strains. The Bacteroides strains studied contain similarities and differences in the numbers and types of transport proteins tabulated, but both OP and PAP strains contain similar outer membrane carbohydrate receptors, pore-forming toxins and protein secretion systems, the similarities were noteworthy, but these Bacteroides strains showed striking differences with probiotic and pathogenic enteric bacteria, particularly with respect to their high affinity outer membrane receptors and auxiliary proteins involved in complex carbohydrate utilization. The results reveal striking similarities between the PAP and OP species of Bacteroides, and suggest that OP species may possess currently unrecognized pathogenic potential. © 2018 Zafar, Saier.

However, the impact of this probiotic on the gut microbiome has not been fully elucidated, especially, when used with antimicrobials. Material and methods: In an in vivo study, CBM 588 monotherapy, clindamycin monotherapy, CBM 588 and clindamycin (combination therapy), or normal saline (control) was orally administered to mice for 4 days, and fecal samples were collected for 18 days to enumerate C. butyricum. We also extracted DNA from these fecal samples for metagenomics analysis by amplification of the V3-V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene and MiSeq Illumina sequencing. In addition, the concentrations of some short chain fatty acids were assessed in the fecal samples. A histological analysis was also conducted. Results: On day 4 (the last treatment day), there was no difference in the total counts of C. butyricum between the CBM 588 monotherapy and combination therapy groups (5.21 ± 0.78 vs. 5.13 ± 0.45 log 10 cfu/g, p = 0.86). Clindamycin treatment resulted in dramatic increases in the phylum Firmicutes, especially Enterobacteriaceae, Clostridiaceae, Lactobacillus, and Enterococcus, compared with the other groups during the treatment period. CBM 588 treatment modified the bacterial community composition at lower phylogenetic levels. Some bacterial taxa, such as Bifidobacterium, Coprococcus, and Bacteroides, were significantly increased in the combination therapy group when compared with the other groups. In the metabolic analysis, CBM 588 enhanced lactic acid production. It also enhanced the efficiency of lactic acid use for the production of butyric acid. Only the clindamycin monotherapy group showed abnormal colon tissue, with superficial epithelial necrosis and the presence of inflammatory cells. Conclusion: CBM 588 treatment modulated the gut microbiota composition under dysbiosis due to the use of an antimicrobial with strong activity against anaerobes and significantly reduced epithelial damage. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",20.0

Gut flora can modulate the host response to chemotherapeutic drugs. However, the understanding regarding the relationship between the gut microbiota and the antitumor efficacy of 5- Fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment is limited. Therefore, we compared the tumor size and profiled the gut microbiota of mice treated with 5-FU, combined with probiotics or ABX (an antibiotic cocktail of antibiotics) by using the Colorectal Cancer (CRC) mouse model and high-throughput sequencing. The results elucidated that ABX administration diminished the antitumor efficacy of 5-FU in mice and supplementation of probiotics upon 5-FU treatment could not significantly increase the efficacy of 5-FU treatment, despite improving mice body weight at day 33. There were significant differences in fecal bacteria community among the four groups (ANOSIM p < 0.05). ABX administration reduced microbiota biodiversity and altered microbiota community. The pathogenic bacteria included Escherichia shigella and Enterobacter significantly increased, while other commensal bacterial decreased unidentified Firmicutes increased and the opportunistic pathogens decreased after the administration of Probiotics. In addition, 5-FU treatment also changed the diversity and the community composition of the gut mirobiota. The relative abundance of genus Lachnospiracea_NK4 A136, Bacteroides, Odoribacter, Mucispirillum, and Blautia were significantly increased compared to the control group. Additionally, functional capacity analysis of gut microbiota using PICRUSt showed that genes involved in amino acid metabolism, replication and repair translation, nucleotide metabolism expressed much lower in FU.ABX group than the other groups. The current results suggest that ABX administration disrupted the gut microbiota in mice, which contributed to the reduction of antitumor efficacy of 5-FU. © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS",67.0

We previously described dysbiosis in children with IgE-mediated CMA and the effect of dietary treatment with extensively hydrolyzed casein formula (EHCF) alone or in combination with the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG). On the contrary, the gut microbiota in non-IgE-mediated CMA remains uncharacterized. In this study we evaluated gut microbiota composition and fecal butyrate levels in children affected by non-IgE-mediated CMA. We found a gut microbiota dysbiosis in non-IgE-mediated CMA, driven by an enrichment of Bacteroides and Alistipes. Comparing these results with those previously obtained in children with IgE-mediated CMA, we demonstrated overlapping signatures in the gut microbiota dysbiosis of non-IgE-mediated and IgE-mediated CMA children, characterized by a progressive increase in Bacteroides from healthy to IgE-mediated CMA patients. EHCF containg LGG was more strongly associated with an effect on dysbiosis and on butyrate production if compared to what observed in children treated with EHCF alone. If longitudinal cohort studies in children with CMA will confirm these results, gut microbiota dysbiosis could be a relevant target for innovative therapeutic strategies in children with non-IgE-mediated CMA. © 2018, The Author(s).",39.0

While each of these states is generally resilient, certain perturbations such as antibiotics, probiotics, and diet shifts, result in transitions to other states. Can we reliably both predict such stable states as well as direct and control transitions between them? Here we present a new conceptual model—inspired by the stable marriage problem in game theory and economics—in which microbial communities naturally exhibit multiple stable states, each state with a different species’ abundance profile. Our model’s core ingredient is that microbes utilize nutrients one at a time while competing with each other. Using only two ranked tables, one with microbes’ nutrient preferences and one with their competitive abilities, we can determine all possible stable states as well as predict inter-state transitions, triggered by the removal or addition of a specific nutrient or microbe. Further, using an example of seven Bacteroides species common to the human gut utilizing nine polysaccharides, we predict that mutual complementarity in nutrient preferences enables these species to coexist at high abundances. © 2018, International Society for Microbial Ecology.",33.0

Some bacteria target GAGs for adhesion and/or infection to host cells, although no probiotics have been known to degrade GAGs. Here, we show GAG degradation by probiotics from human gut microbiota and their adhesion to human intestinal cells through a GAG. GAG-degrading bacteria were isolated from human faeces and identified as Enterococcus faecium, and some typical probiotics such as Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Enterococcus faecalis were also found to degrade heparin. GAG-degrading lactobacilli and enterococci including the isolated E. faecium possessed a genetic cluster encoding GAG-degrading/metabolising enzymes in the bacterial genome. KduI and KduD enzymes encoded in the GAG cluster of L. rhamnosus functioned as 4-deoxy-l-Threo-5-hexosulose-uronate ketol-isomerase and 2-keto-3-deoxy-d-gluconate dehydrogenase, respectively, both of which were crucial for GAG metabolism. GAG-degrading L. rhamnosus and E. faecium attached to human intestinal Caco-2 cells via heparin. Some species of Bacteroides, considered to be the next generation probiotics, degraded chondroitin sulfate C and hyaluronan, and genes coding for the Bacteroides GAG-degrading enzyme were frequently detected from human gut microbiota.

Uveitis is associated with systemic infectious and autoimmune diseases, but in most cases, the aetiology remains unidentified. Dysbiosis in the gut microbiome has been implicated in autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases, cancers and mental disorders. In a mice model of autoimmune UVT, it was observed that manipulating the gut microbiome reduces the inflammation and disease severity. Further, alterations in the bacterial gut microbiome and their metabolites were reported in UVT patients from a Chinese cohort. Hence, it is worth comparing the bacterial gut microbiome of UVT patients with that of healthy controls (HC) to ascertain whether dysbiosis of the gut microbiome has implications in UVT. Our analyses showed reduced diversity of several anti-inflammatory organisms including Faecalibacterium, Bacteroides, Lachnospira, Ruminococcus and members of Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae families, and enrichment of Prevotella (proinflammatory) and Streptococcus (pathogenic) OTUs in UVT microbiomes compared to HC. In addition, decrease in probiotic and antibacterial organisms was observed in UVT compared to HC microbiomes. Heatmap and PCoA plots also indicated significant variations in the microbiomes of UVT versus HC.

Previously, we have reported that the abundance of genus Bacteroides is lower in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) than in patients without CAD with coronary risk factors or in healthy volunteers. However, it remains unclear which and how specific gut bacteria contribute to the progression of atherosclerosis. Methods: We recruited patients with CAD patients and controls without CAD with coronary risk factors. We then compared gut microbial composition using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing in fecal samples to detect species with differential abundance between 2 groups. Subsequently, we used atherosclerosis-prone mice to study the mechanisms underlying the relationship between such species and atherosclerosis. Results: Human fecal 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing revealed a significantly lower abundance of Bacteroides vulgatus and Bacteroides dorei in patients with CAD. This significant differential abundance was confirmed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Gavage with live B. vulgatus and B. dorei attenuated atherosclerotic lesion formation in atherosclerosis-prone mice, markedly ameliorating endotoxemia followed by decreasing gut microbial lipopolysaccharide production, effectively suppressing proinflammatory immune responses. Furthermore, fecal lipopolysaccharide levels in patients with CAD were significantly higher and negatively correlated with the abundance of B. vulgatus and B. dorei. Conclusions: Our translational research findings identify a previously unknown link between specific gut bacteria and atherosclerosis.

Bacteroides spp. are prominent components of the human gut microbiota, and OMVs produced by these species are proposed to play key roles in gut homeostasis. OMV biogenesis in Bacteroides is a poorly understood process. Here, we revisited the protein composition of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron OMVs by mass spectrometry. We confirmed that OMVs produced by this organism contain large quantities of glycosidases and proteases, with most of them being lipoproteins. We found that most of these OMV-enriched lipoproteins are encoded by polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs), such as the sus operon. We examined the subcellular locations of the components of the Sus system and found a split localization; the alpha-amylase SusG is highly enriched in OMVs, while the oligosaccharide importer SusC remains mostly in the OM. We found that all OMV-enriched lipoproteins possess a lipoprotein export sequence (LES), and we show that this signal mediates translocation of SusG from the periplasmic face of the OM toward the extracellular milieu. Mutations in the LES motif caused defects in surface exposure and recruitment of SusG into OMVs. These experiments link, for the first time, surface exposure to recruitment of proteins into OMVs. We also show that surface-exposed SusG in OMVs is active and rescues the growth of bacterial cells incapable of growing on starch as the only carbon source. Our results support the role of OMVs as ""public goods"" that can be utilized by other organisms with different metabolic capabilities. IMPORTANCE Species from the Bacteroides genus are predominant members of the human gut microbiota. OMVs in Bacteroides have been shown to be important for the homeostasis of complex host-commensal relationships, mainly involving immune tolerance and protection from disease. OMVs carry many enzymatic activities involved in the cleavage of complex polysaccharides and have been proposed as public goods that can provide growth to other bacterial species by release of polysaccharide breakdown products into the gut lumen. This work shows that the presence of a negatively charged rich amino acid motif (LES) is required for efficient packing of the surface-exposed alpha-amylase SusG into OMVs. Our findings strongly suggest that surface exposure is coupled to packing of Bacteroides lipoproteins into OMVs. This is the first step in the generation of tailor-made probiotic interventions that can exploit LES-related sequences to generate Bacteroides strains displaying proteins of interest in OMVs. © 2018 Valguarnera et al.",20.0

However, there are mixed results on whether probiotics could impact the gut microbiome and/or help to decrease liver fat and obesity outcomes. Objective: This study aimed to determine whether a probiotic supplement (VSL#3 ® ) intervention altered gut microbiota and/or gut hormones associated with appetite regulation. The secondary aim of this study was to determine whether VSL#3 ® altered body composition and liver fat and fibrosis. Methods: We conducted a double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial in 19 obese Latino adolescents. The intervention consisted of three packets per day of VSL#3 ® or a matched placebo for 16 weeks. Pre-intervention and post-intervention measures included gut microbial abundance, gut appetite regulating hormones, anthropometrics, body composition, liver fat and liver fibrosis. We conducted linear models to determine whether there were any significant differences in the changes in these outcomes following VSL#3 ® intervention. Results: Compared with placebo, adolescents that received VSL#3 had significant increases in total adiposity (%) (+1.7 ± 0.6 vs. −1.3 ± 0.5, p &lt; 0.01) and trunk adiposity (%) (+3.3 ± 0.8 vs. −1.8 ± 0.8, p &lt; 0.01) with no significant effects on liver fat/fibrosis, insulin/glucose, gut microbial abundances or gut hormones. Conclusion: VSL#3 supplementation may lead to increased adiposity in obese Latino adolescents with no significant detectable changes in gut microbiota, gut appetite-regulating hormones, liver fat and fibrosis and dietary intake.

Here we analyse longitudinal stool samples from 903 children between 3 and 46 months of age by 16S rRNA gene sequencing (n = 12,005) and metagenomic sequencing (n = 10,867), as part of the The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY) study. We show that the developing gut microbiome undergoes three distinct phases of microbiome progression: a developmental phase (months 3–14), a transitional phase (months 15–30), and a stable phase (months 31–46). Receipt of breast milk, either exclusive or partial, was the most significant factor associated with the microbiome structure. Breastfeeding was associated with higher levels of Bifidobacterium species (B. breve and B. bifidum), and the cessation of breast milk resulted in faster maturation of the gut microbiome, as marked by the phylum Firmicutes. Birth mode was also significantly associated with the microbiome during the developmental phase, driven by higher levels of Bacteroides species (particularly B. fragilis) in infants delivered vaginally. Bacteroides was also associated with increased gut diversity and faster maturation, regardless of the birth mode. Environmental factors including geographical location and household exposures (such as siblings and furry pets) also represented important covariates. A nested case–control analysis revealed subtle associations between microbial taxonomy and the development of islet autoimmunity or type 1 diabetes.

With the aim to reduce the use of antibiotic growth promoters (AGPs) and to maintain the growth and development of pullets, the effect of simultaneous short-termed supplementation of AGPs (bacitracin zinc 20 mg/kg and colistin sulfate 4 mg/kg) and Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis) DSM17299 probiotic, as well as the effect of supplementation of AGPs (bacitracin zinc 20 mg/kg and colistin sulfate 4 mg/kg) during the whole period (0~16 weeks) on the overall growth and development, intestinal health, and caecal microbiota of pullets were evaluated. In the present study, a total of 630 one-day-old Hy-Line Brown layers were randomly distributed into five equal groups: Including the AGPs group (supplemented with AGPs based on basal diets for 16 weeks), the BA3 group (supplemented with AGPs and B. subtilis based on basal diets for 3 weeks), the BA6 group (for 6 weeks), the BA12 group (for 12 weeks), and the BA16 group (for 16 weeks). When compared with the AGPs group, the supplementation of AGPs + B. subtilis for the first 3 weeks could maintain overall growth performance, including the average body weight, average feed intake, average daily weight gain, and feed conversion ratio of pullets at 3, 6, 12, and 16 weeks of age (P > 0.05). Meanwhile, the characteristic growth indexes in different periods were separately measured. At 3 weeks of age, the amylase activity in ileum was elevated (P = 0.028), and the length of tibia was up to the standard in the BA3 group. At 12 weeks of age, the increased villus height (P = 0.046) of jejunum, increased villus height (P = 0.023) and ratio of villus height to crypt depth (P = 0.012) of ileum, decreased crypt depth (P = 0.002) of ileum, and elevated mRNA levels of sucrase in jejunum (P < 0.05) were all identified in the BA3 group. At 16 weeks of age, the secreted immunoglobulin A (sIgA) content in the jejunum mucosa of the BA3 group was greater than the other groups (P < 0.001). Furthermore, altered intestinal microbiota was found in the BA3 group. Specifically, decreased amounts of Alistipes, Bacteroides, Odoribacter, Dehalobacterium, and Sutterella and increased amounts of Lactobacillus, Dorea, Ruminococcus, and Oscillospira were determined (P < 0.05) in the BA3 group at week 6. Meanwhile, decreased amounts of B. fragilis and C. leptum (P < 0.05) were identified in the BA3 group at week 12, which were found to be relevant for the improvement of intestinal morphology (P < 0.05) by Pearson analysis.

Methods: Mouse model of UC was produced using dextran sulphate sodium (DSS). The mice were divided into seven groups, viz, reference group, MRS-L medium-negative control group, mesalamine-positive control group, high dose bifidobacteria (MIMBb75) group, middle dose MIMBb75 group and low dose MIMBb75 group. Normal mice were used as control. All mice were sacrificed at day 7 of treatment, and colon length, hemoglobin concentration and intestinal flora were determined. Results: Bifidobacteria inhibited UC-induced decreases in mice hemoglobin and UC-induced colon shortening. In addition, it augmented the diversity of intestinal flora and increased the number of bacteroides and Clostridium leptum. Conclusion: Bifidobacteria plays a therapeutic role in UC via regulation of intestinal microflora. © Pharmacotherapy Group, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Benin, Benin City, 300001 Nigeria and 2018 The authors.",

We previously isolated a new strain of B. fragilis (ZY-312) and verified its biosafety and capability of inhibiting the growth of pathogens in vivo. However, the colonization of ZY-312 in gastrointestinal (GI) tract remains to be determined. To track the colonization of ZY-312, mice were gavaged with ZY-312 labeled by means of metabolic oligosaccharide engineering and bioorthogonal click chemistry or given AF647-dibenzocyclooctyne (DIBO) directly. Then the fluorescence was detected in GI tract, spleen and kidneys. Results showed that ZY-312 could be labeled by metabolic oligosaccharide engineering, and the optimal incubation time with AF647-DIBO was 5 h in vitro. Following oral gavage with AF647-DIBO labeled ZY-312 or AF647-DIBO alone, mice were subjected to in vivo imaging and the fluorescence intensity was similar in both groups 3 h, 6 h, and 12 h post the gavage. The fluorescence of AF647-DIBO group disappeared 24 h post gavage which was probably due to the excretion via GI tract. While the fluorescence of AF647-DIBO labeled ZY-312 retained in the cecum for as long as 48 h. Immunofluorescence assay further confirmed that labeled ZY-312 transiently colonized not only in cecum but also in stomach, ileum and colon of mice 48 h post-gavage and that no massive accumulation of ZY-312 was detected in other organs such as kidneys and spleen. In conclusion, ZY-312 could transiently colonize in GI tract, mainly in cecum, for at least 48 h, and it hardly disseminate to other organs, which shed new light on the future development of B. fragilis as a probiotic product. © 2007 - 2018 Frontiers Media S.A.

Methods: 16S-rRNA genome sequencing technique is used to detect the characteristics of intestinal microbiota in untreated CD patients and healthy controls. Then the study investigates the effects of R. intestinalis on disease activity index score, intestinal pathology, the differentiation of Treg cells, and the expressions of Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), TGF-β and IL-10 by using TNBS colitis models. At the cellular level, the study uses LPS to stimulate Caco-2 cells to conduct inflammation models and then co-culture with R. intestinalis and detect changes of TSLP and TGF-β. The study then uses R. intestinalis to stimulate peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and the change of Treg cells was detected. Results: Genome sequencing of fecal samples from untreated CD patients (n = 10) revealed decreases in the abundance and diversity of intestinal microbiota, including R. intestinalis. Moreover, R. intestinalis reduced disease activity index scores, colon shortening, intestinal mucosal epithelial injury, and mucosal lymphocyte infiltration in a colitis mice model. It suppressed intestinal inflammation by increasing Treg cell numbers and expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokines TSLP, TGF-β, and interleukin-10 (P < 0.05). R. intestinalis also increased secretion of TSLP and TGF-β in lipopolysaccharide-treated Caco-2 cells. Conclusion: These findings suggest that R. intestinalis suppresses CD pathogenesis by inducing anti-inflammatory responses. © 2018 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd",43.0

METHODS Specific pathogen-free Brown Norway (BN) rats and Lewis rats were separated into five groups: (1) Tolerance group (BN-BN LT, n = 8); (2) rejection group (Lewis-BN LT, n = 8); (3) high dosage FK506 (FK506-H) group (Lewis-BN LT, n = 8); (4) middle dosage FK506 (FK506-M) group (Lewis-BN LT, n = 8); and (5) low dosage FK506 (FK506-L) group (Lewis-BN LT, n = 8). FK506 was administered to recipients at a dose of 1.0 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg, and 0.1 mg/kg body weight for 29 d after LT to the FK506-H, FK506-M, and FK506-L groups, respectively. On the 30th day after LT, all rats were sampled and euthanized. Blood samples were harvested for liver function and plasma endotoxin testing. Hepatic graft and ileocecal tissues were collected for histopathology observation. Ileocecal contents were used for DNA extraction, Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and digital processing of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) profiles and analysis. RESULTS Compared to the FK506-H and FK506-L groups, FK506-M was optimal for maintaining immunosuppression and inducing normal graft function; the FK506-M maintained gut barrier integrity and low plasma endotoxin levels; furthermore, DGGE results showed that FK506-M induced stable gut microbiota. Diversity analysis indicated that FK506-M increased species richness and rare species abundance, and cluster analysis confirmed the stable gut microbiota induced by FK506-M. Phylogenetic tree analysis identified crucial bacteria associated with FK506-M; seven of the nine bacteria that were decreased corresponded to Bacteroidetes , while increased bacteria were of the Bifidobacterium species. FK506-M increased Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Bifidobacterium spp . and decreased Bacteroides-Prevotella and Enterobacteriaceae , as assessed by RT-PCR, which confirmed the crucial bacterial alterations identified through DGGE. CONCLUSION Compared to the low or high dosage of FK506, an optimal dosage of FK506 induced immunosuppression, normal graft function and stable gut microbiota following LT in rats. The stable gut microbiota presented increased probiotics and decreased potential pathogenic endotoxin-producing bacteria. These findings provide a novel strategy based on gut microbiota for immunosuppressive dosage assessment for recipients following LT. © The Author(s) 2018.

Majority of the human diseases are associated with the development of intestinal dysbiosis. Dysbiotic condition or dysbiosis is a key pathogenic condition causing many severe infectious or non-infectious diseases. Rapid return to the original microbiota in many cases leads to the fast recovery from the disease. However, the optimal way of the treatment of dysbiosis is still under the discussion. Recently we have developed a method of autoprobiotics based on using isolated indigenous bacteria for improving of microbiota condition. The method based on feeding the patients with bacterial products grown from their personal, genetically characterised strains have been successfully tested in clinic on patients with IBS or chronic pneumonia. In present study we tried to evaluate technology employing autoprobiotic bacteria belonging to different species employing the rat model of antibiotic induced dysbiosis. Six experimental groups of animals after taking antibiotics were treated with different variants of autoprobiotics (lactobacillus, bifidobacteria, enterococcus, their mixture, fecal microbiota, or anaerobically grown complex of indigenous microbiota) prepared for each of them before the development of dysbiosis. Judging by the multiple parameters including metagenomics analysis of microbiota, immune status and microbiota content of the animals with dysbiosis relatively to control group, the most pronounced positive changes were provided by autoprobiotics based on enterococci, bifidobacteria or the consortium of indigenous bacteria grown under anaerobic conditions. These groups of autoprobiotics were delivering the most effective restoration of the original microbiota content and significant anti-inflammatory reaction of the immune system. © 2007-2018 Frontiers Media S.A.

Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive, facultative anaerobic bacteria, it causes human infection worldwide, and is a major pathogen that causes intestinal infection. Mixed lactic acid bacteria (LAB) may have potential in the prevention and treatment of S. aureus infection. In the present study, we examined the effects of mixed LAB treatment on intestinal microbiota modulation in mice infected with S. aureus. Results: High-throughput sequencing of the V3-V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene showed that the mixed LAB maintained the richness and diversity of the microbiota in the mouse intestine. By establishing operational taxonomic units and using rarefaction analysis, rank-abundance distribution curves, heat maps, Venn diagrams, bacterial community structures, and hierarchical clustering analysis, Bacteroidales, Lachnospiraceae, Bacteroides and Prevotellaceae were the most abundant taxa in the samples, we found that the composition of the intestinal microbiota was similar between the protection group administered mixed LAB and the negative control group. Conclusions: Staphylococcus aureus destroys the stable intestinal microbiota structure of mice, treatment with mixed LAB could prevent S. aureus infection in mice and improve the structure of the intestinal microbiota. © 2018 The Author(s).",6.0

However, evidence of probiotic gut mucosal colonization efficacy remains sparse and controversial. We metagenomically characterized the murine and human mucosal-associated gastrointestinal microbiome and found it to only partially correlate with stool microbiome. A sequential invasive multi-omics measurement at baseline and during consumption of an 11-strain probiotic combination or placebo demonstrated that probiotics remain viable upon gastrointestinal passage. In colonized, but not germ-free mice, probiotics encountered a marked mucosal colonization resistance. In contrast, humans featured person-, region- and strain-specific mucosal colonization patterns, hallmarked by predictive baseline host and microbiome features, but indistinguishable by probiotics presence in stool. Consequently, probiotics induced a transient, individualized impact on mucosal community structure and gut transcriptome. Collectively, empiric probiotics supplementation may be limited in universally and persistently impacting the gut mucosa, meriting development of new personalized probiotic approaches. Probiotics transiently colonize the human gut mucosa in highly individualized patterns, thereby differentially impacting the indigenous microbiome and host gene-expression profile, a trait which is predictable by baseline host and microbiome features, but not by stool shedding. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",558.0

To test our hypothesis, we investigated whether maternal factors during pregnancy, such as biodiversity of the living environment, influence the microbiome of the first stool more than immediate perinatal factors. Methods: We recruited 218 consecutive newborn infants from one hospital. Regions of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene were sequenced to characterize the microbiomes of the first-pass meconium samples (N=212). We used a multivariate model to determine both the prenatal and perinatal factors affecting the microbiome. Results: The number of operational taxonomic units ranged from 0 to 448 per newborn. The most abundant phyla were Firmicutes, with a relative abundance of 44%, Proteobacteria, 28%, and Bacteroidetes, 15%. By a multivariate analysis, the biodiversity of the home environment increased the diversity of microbiomes, whereas perinatal factors, such as the delivery mode or exposure to antimicrobials during labor did not have an effect. Conclusion: The microbiome of the first-pass meconium was not altered by immediate perinatal factors, but was affected by maternal factors during pregnancy, implying the in utero transfer of microbes and the development of the gut microbiota niche in fetal life. © 2018, International Pediatric Research Foundation, Inc.",30.0

Randomized controlled trials of probiotics suggest some associations with adiposity, lipids, and insulin resistance, but to our knowledge no trials with ""hard"" outcomes have been conducted. We used separate-sample Mendelian randomization to obtain estimates of the associations of 27 genera of gut microbiotawith ischemic heart disease, type 2 diabetesmellitus, adiposity, lipid levels, and insulin resistance, based on summary data from CARDIoGRAAMplusC4D and other consortia. Among the 27 genera, a 1-allele increase in single nucleotide polymorphisms related to greater abundance of Bifidobacterium was associated with lower risk of ischemic heart disease (odds ratio = 0.985, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.971, 1.000; P = 0.04), a 0.011-standard-deviation lower body mass index (95% CI: -0.017, -0.005), and a 0.026-standard-deviation higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (95% CI: 0.019, 0.033), but the findings were not robust to exclusion of potential pleiotropy.We also identified Acidaminococcus, Aggregatibacter, Anaerostipes, Blautia, Desulfovibrio, Dorea, andFaecalibacteriumas being nominally associated with type 2 diabetesmellitus or other risk factors.

Probiotics are often recommended to mitigate CDI symptoms; however, there exists only limited evidence showing probiotic efficacy for CDI. Here, we examined changes to the GI microbiota in a study population where probiotic treatment was associated with significantly reduced duration of CDI diarrhea. Subjects being treated with standard of care antibiotics for a primary episode of CDI were randomized to probiotic treatment or placebo for 4 weeks. Probiotic treatment consisted of a daily multi-strain capsule (Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM, ATCC 700396; Lactobacillus paracasei Lpc-37, ATCC SD5275; Bifidobacterium lactis Bi-07, ATCC SC5220; Bifidobacterium lactis B1-04, ATCC SD5219) containing 1.7 x 10 10 CFUs. Stool was collected and analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing. Microbiome analysis revealed apparent taxonomic differences between treatments and timepoints. Subjects administered probiotics had reduced Verrucomicrobiaceae at week 8 compared to controls. Bacteroides were significantly reduced between weeks 0 to 4 in probiotic treated subjects. Ruminococcus (family Lachnospiraceae), tended to be more abundant at week 8 than week 4 within the placebo group and at week 8 than week 0 within the probiotic group. Similar to these results, previous studies have associated these taxa with probiotic use and with mitigation of CDI symptoms. Compositional prediction of microbial community function revealed that subjects in the placebo group had microbiomes enriched with the iron complex transport system, while probiotic treated subjects had microbiomes enriched with the antibiotic transport system. Results indicate that probiotic use may impact the microbiome function in the face of a CDI; yet, more sensitive methods with higher resolution are warranted to better elucidate the roles associated with these changes. Continuing studies are needed to better understand probiotic effects on microbiome structure and function and the resulting impacts on CDI. © This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

Previous studies have shown that consuming particular probiotic strains of Lactobacillus is associated with improvement in the obese and diabetic phenotype; however, the mechanisms of these beneficial effects are not well understood. In this study, C57BL/6J male mice were fed a lard-based high fat diet for 15 weeks with Lactobacillus plantarum supplementation NCIMB8826 (Lp) between weeks 10 and 15 (n = 10 per group). Systemic metabolic effects of supplementation were analyzed by NMR metabolomics, protein expression assays, gene transcript quantification, and 16S rRNA marker gene sequencing. Body and organ weights were not significantly different with Lp supplementation, and no microbiota community structure changes were observed in the cecum; however, L. plantarum numbers were increased in the treatment group according to culture-based and 16S rRNA gene quantification. Significant differences in metabolite and protein concentrations (serum, liver, and colon), gene expression (ileum and adipose), and cytokines (colon) were observed between groups with increases in the gene expression of tight junction proteins in the ileum and cecum and improvement of some markers of glucose homeostasis in blood and tissue with Lp supplementation. These results indicate Lp supplementation impacts systemic metabolism and immune signaling before phenotypic changes and without large-scale changes to the microbiome. This study supports the notion that Lp is a beneficial probiotic, even in the context of a high fat diet. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",18.0

GI symptoms are of particular interest in this population due to prevalence and correlation with the severity of behavioural traits. Nowadays, there is lack of strong evidence about the effect of dietary interventions on these problems, particularly prebiotics. Therefore, we assessed the impact of exclusion diets and a 6-week Bimuno® galactooligosaccharide (B-GOS®) prebiotic intervention in 30 autistic children. Results: The results showed that children on exclusion diets reported significantly lower scores of abdominal pain and bowel movement, as well as lower abundance of Bifidobacterium spp. and Veillonellaceae family, but higher presence of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Bacteroides spp. In addition, significant correlations were found between bacterial populations and faecal amino acids in this group, compared to children following an unrestricted diet. Following B-GOS® intervention, we observed improvements in anti-social behaviour, significant increase of Lachnospiraceae family, and significant changes in faecal and urine metabolites. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first study where the effect of exclusion diets and prebiotics has been evaluated in autism, showing potential beneficial effects. A combined dietary approach resulted in significant changes in gut microbiota composition and metabolism suggesting that multiple interventions might be more relevant for the improvement of these aspects as well as psychological traits. © 2018 The Author(s).",119.0

The present study aimed to investigate whether D. indusiata polysaccharide (DIP) could modulate the recovery of gut microbiota composition and intestinal barrier function after broad-spectrum antibiotic-driven dysbiosis. Alteration and restoration in the microbial communities were elucidated by the Illumina MiSeq platform. Colon histology, expression of tight-junction associated proteins, and serum/tissue endotoxin and cytokine levels were evaluated. Two-week daily oral administration of clindamycin and metronidazole resulted in reduced bacterial diversity and richness, and perturbed the microbial flora at various taxonomic levels (altered Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and increased relative abundance of harmful flora (Proteobacteria, Enterococcus, and Bacteroides)), whereas DIP administration reversed the dysbiosis and increased beneficial flora, including Lactobacillaceae (lactic acid-producing bacteria), and Ruminococaceae (butyrate-producing bacteria). In addition, it resulted in the reduction of endotoxemia (through lipopolysaccharides (LPSs)) and pro-inflammatory cytokine (tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and interleukin 1β (IL-1β)) levels, with the increased expression of tight-junction associated proteins (claudin-1, occludin, and zonula occludens-1). These findings not only suggested a comprehensive understanding of the protective effects of a DIP in the restoration of gut microbiota but also highlighted its role in the enhancement of gut barrier integrity, reduction of inflammation and lowering of endotoxin levels in mice. © 2018 by the authors.

We assessed dietary habits using a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) in native Chinese community volunteers. Based on the dietary fat content determined using the FFQ, the volunteers were divided into HFD group (≥40% of dietary calories came from fat) or low-fat diet (LFD) group (<40%). Fecal and colonic mucosal microbiota composition was determined using 16S rDNA based methods. In stool matter of HFD group, Prevotella and Abiotrophia showed significantly higher abundance, whereas unclassified genus of S24-7 (family level) of Bacteroidetes, Gemmiger, Akkermansia and Rothia were less abundant. On colonic mucosal tissue testing, unclassified genus of S24-7 showed significantly higher abundance while Bacteroides, Coprobacter, Abiotrophia, and Asteroleplasma were less abundant in HFD group.

This ecosystem is known to be shaped by many factors, including climate, geography, host nutrition, lifestyle and medication. Thus, knowledge of varying populations with different habits is important for a better understanding of the microbiome. Design We therefore conducted a metagenomic analysis of intestinal microbiota from Kazakh donors, recruiting 84 subjects, including male and female healthy subjects and metabolic syndrome (MetS) patients aged 25-75 years, from the Kazakh administrative centre, Astana. We characterise and describe these microbiomes, the first deep-sequencing cohort from Central Asia, in comparison with a global dataset (832 individuals from five countries on three continents), and explore correlations between microbiota, clinical and laboratory parameters as well as with nutritional data from Food Frequency Questionnaires. Results We observe that Kazakh microbiomes are relatively different from both European and East Asian counterparts, though similar to other Central Asian microbiomes, with the most striking difference being significantly more samples falling within the Prevotella-rich enterotype, potentially reflecting regional diet and lifestyle. We show that this enterotype designation remains stable within an individual over time in 82% of cases. We further observe gut microbiome features that distinguish MetS patients from controls (eg, significantly reduced Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio, Bifidobacteria and Subdoligranulum, alongside increased Prevotella), though these overlap little with previously published reports and thus may reflect idiosyncrasies of the present cohort.

The development of preservation techniques is of major importance for therapeutic application. This study investigated cryopreservation (−80°C) and lyophilization survival and storage stability (4°C for 3 months) of the strict anaerobic gut microbes Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Roseburia intestinalis, Anaerostipes caccae, Eubacterium hallii and Blautia obeum. To improve preservation survival, protectants sucrose and inulin (both 5% w/v) were added for lyophilization and were also combined with glycerol (15% v/v) for cryopreservation. Bacterial fitness, evaluated by maximum growth rate and lag phase, viability and membrane integrity were determined using a standardized growth assay and by flow cytometry as markers for preservation resistance. Lyophilization was more detrimental to viability and fitness than cryopreservation, but led to better storage stability. Adding sucrose and inulin enhanced viability and the proportion of intact cells during lyophilization of all strains. Viability of protectant-free B. thetaiotaomicron, A. caccae and F. prausnitzii was above 50% after cryopreservation and storage and increased to above 80% if protectants were present. The addition of glycerol, sucrose and inulin strongly enhanced the viability of B. obeum, E. hallii and R. intestinalis from 0.03–2% in protectant-free cultures to 11–37%. This is the first study that quantitatively compared the effect of cryopreservation and lyophilization and the addition of selected protectants on viability and fitness of six strict anaerobic gut microbes. Our results suggest that efficiency of protectants is process- and species-specific. © 2018 The Authors.

Methods: To investigate the correlation between the intestinal microflora and efficacy of Rosuvastatin, we analyzed the diversity of intestinal microflora using PCR-DGGE analysis and 16S rDNA sequencing approaches. Furthermore, we compared the blood lipid levels of rat models with dysbiosis of intestinal microflora and control rats upon the Rosuvastatin administration. Results: The diversity of the intestinal flora was obviously decreased upon the antibiotic treatment, this effect could be maintained for 2 weeks after establishment of the models. Importantly, the results from 16S rDNA sequencing demonstrated that the abundance of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium was remarkably diminished upon the antibiotic treatment in antibiotic+Rosuvastatin-treated group compared to that of Rosuvastatin-treated group and control group. Correspondently, the lipid-reduction efficacy of Rosuvastatin was significantly compromised. However, the diversity of the intestinal flora was recovered 4 weeks after the antibiotic treatment. Subsequently, the lipid-reduction efficacy of Rosuvastatin was also recovered to level of the control rats treated with Rosuvastatin alone. Conclusion: Intestinal flora could play an essential role in mediating the lipid-reduction efficacy of Rosuvastatin. © 2018 The Author(s).",11.0

METHODS Twenty-four male C57BL/6J mice were equally divided into four groups and fed a methionine-choline-sufficient diet for 2 wk (Control 2w group, n = 6) or 4 wk (Control 4w group, n = 6) or the MCD diet for 2 wk (MCD 2w group, n = 6) or 4 wk (MCD 4w group, n = 6). Liver injury, fibrosis, and intestinal barrier function were evaluated after 2 and 4 wk of feeding. The fecal microbiome and metabolome were studied using 16s rRNA deep sequencing and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. RESULTS The mice fed the MCD diet presented with simple hepatic steatosis and slight intestinal barrier deterioration after 2 wk. After 4 wk of feeding with the MCD diet, however, the mice developed prominent NASH with liver fibrosis, and the intestinal barrier was more impaired. Compared with the control diet, the MCD diet induced gradual gut microbiota dysbiosis, as evidenced by a marked decrease in the abundance of Alistipes and the (Eubacterium) coprostanoligenes group (P < 0.001 and P < 0.05, respectively) and a significant increase in Ruminococcaceae UCG 014 abundance (P < 0.05) after 2 wk. At 4 wk, the MCD diet significantly reduced the promising probiotic Bifidobacterium levels and markedly promotedBacteroides abundance (P < 0.05, andP < 0.01, respectively). The fecal metabolomic profile was also substantially altered by the MCD diet: At 2 wk, arachidic acid, hexadecane, palmitic acid, and tetracosane were selected as potential biomarkers that were significantly different in the corresponding control group, and at 4 wk, cholic acid, cholesterol, arachidic acid, tetracosane, and stearic acid were selected. CONCLUSION The MCD diet induced persistent alterations in the gut microbiota and metabolome. © The Author(s) 2018. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc. All rights reserved.",35.0

The hamster model utilizing an oral route for infection of C. difficile has been considered to be the standard model for analysis of C. difficile infection (CDI) but this model exhibits differences to human CDI, most notably as most hamsters die without exhibiting diarrhea. Therefore, we attempted to develop a new non-lethal and diarrheal rat CDI model caused by endogenous C. difficile using metronidazole (MNZ) and egg white. In addition, the effects of probiotic strain Clostridium butyricum MIYAIRI 588 (CBM) on CDI were examined using this model. Syrian Golden hamsters received clindamycin phosphate orally at 30 mg/kg on 5 days before challenge with either C. difficile VPI10463 (hypertoxigenic strain) or KY34 (low toxigenic clinical isolate). Mortality and the presence of diarrhea were observed twice a day for the duration of the experiment. Wistar rats received 10% egg white dissolved in drinking water for 1 week ad libitum following intramuscular administration of 200 mg/kg MNZ twice a day for 3 days. Diarrhea score was determined for each day and fecal water content, biotin concentration, and cytotoxin titer in feces were examined. More than 70% of hamsters orally infected with C. difficile died without exhibiting diarrhea regardless of toxigenicity of strain. The rats receiving egg white after MNZ administration developed diarrhea due to overgrowth of endogenous C. difficile. This CDI model is non-lethal and diarrheal, and some rats in this model were spontaneously cured. The incidence of diarrhea was significantly decreased in C. butyricum treated rats. These results indicate that the CDI model using egg white and MNZ has potentially better similarity to human CDI, and implies that treatment with C. butyricum may reduce the risk of CDI. © 2018 Oka, Osaki, Hanawa, Kurata, Sugiyama, Takahashi, Tanaka, Taguchi and Kamiya.",12.0

It has a notable influence on the patients' quality of life. Regulation of the immune system is one of the important roles of the gut microbiota. The effect of dysbiosis considering some members of gut microbiota in patients with chronic urticaria has been demonstrated in our previous study. Objective: Comparing the frequency and bacterial load of Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Bacteroides between patients with chronic urticaria and healthy controls. Methods: 20 patients with chronic urticaria and 20 age and sex matched healthy individuals were included in the present study. Stool samples were analyzed for determining the frequency and bacterial load of Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Bacteroides genera. Results: There were no significant differences among the frequencies of detectable Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, or Bacteroides in stool samples of patients with chronic urticaria and healthy controls. The relative amounts of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium were significantly higher in fecal samples from controls compared to patients with chronic urticaria (P = 0.038 and 0.039, respectively).

Bifidobacteria and lactobacilli are among the major target microorganisms of oligosaccharides, but the metabolic properties of oligosaccharides in other predominant gut microbes have not been well characterized. In the present study, we demonstrated the metabolic properties of six oligosaccharides in 31 key gut anaerobes. Bifidobacteria readily metabolized fructooligosaccharide (FOSs) with degree of polymerization (DP) 3, i.e. 1-kestose, but several strains used did not actively metabolize FOSs with DP4 and DP5, i.e. nystose and fructosylnystose. Akkermansia muciniphila, a potential new probiotic against obesity, did not show significant growth with any of the oligosaccharides tested. The butyrate producer Anaerostipes caccae grew well on 1-kestose but poorly on FOS mixtures, whereas it contained 1-kestose at 30%. Bacteroides-Parabacteroides group species were separated into two groups based on oligosaccharide metabolic properties. One group metabolized well most of the oligosaccharides tested, but the others metabolized only 1 or 2 selected oligosaccharides. Oligosaccharide profiles after culturing revealed that Bifidobacterium spp. preferentially metabolized shorter oligosaccharides (DP3) in the mixtures, whereas Bacteroides-Parabacteroides spp. did not show oligosaccharide selectivity for metabolism or rather preferred longer oligosaccharides (>DP4). The fermentation profiles indicated specific links between the microbial end-products and specific gut microbes. Available carbohydrates had a significant impact on the accumulation of amino acid-derived bacterial metabolites (i.e. phenol, p-cresol, indole and skatole) and short chain fatty acids. The results assist in predicting the impact of oligosaccharides in human intervention and gut microbiota modulation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",28.0

In the absence of profound perturbation, the bacterial strains that reside within an individual are mostly stable over time 1 . By contrast, the fate of exogenous commensal and probiotic strains applied to an established microbiota is variable, generally unpredictable and greatly influenced by the background microbiota 2,3 . Therefore, analysis of the factors that govern strain engraftment and abundance is of critical importance to the emerging field of microbiome reprogramming. Here we generate an exclusive metabolic niche in mice via administration of a marine polysaccharide, porphyran, and an exogenous Bacteroides strain harbouring a rare gene cluster for porphyran utilization. Privileged nutrient access enables reliable engraftment of the exogenous strain at predictable abundances in mice harbouring diverse communities of gut microbes. This targeted dietary support is sufficient to overcome priority exclusion by an isogenic strain 4, and enables strain replacement. We demonstrate transfer of the 60-kb porphyran utilization locus into a naive strain of Bacteroides, and show finely tuned control of strain abundance in the mouse gut across multiple orders of magnitude by varying porphyran dosage. Finally, we show that this system enables the introduction of a new strain into the colonic crypt ecosystem. These data highlight the influence of nutrient availability in shaping microbiota membership, expand the ability to perform a broad spectrum of investigations in the context of a complex microbiota, and have implications for cell-based therapeutic strategies in the gut. © 2018 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

Probiotics are routinely used to treat AAD in clinical practice; however, the effectiveness and mechanisms by which probiotics alleviate symptoms remain poorly understood. We previously isolated a non-toxic Bacteroides fragilis strain ZY-312, which has been verified to be beneficial in certain infection disorders. However, the precise role of this commensal bacterium in AAD is unknown. In this study, we successfully established an AAD rat model by exposing rats to appropriate antibiotics. These rats developed diarrhea symptoms and showed alterations in their intestinal microbiota, including overgrowth of some pathogenic bacteria. In addition, gastrointestinal barrier defects, indicated by compromised aquaporin expression, aberrant tight junction proteins, and decreased abundance of mucus-filled goblet cells, were also detected in ADD rats compared with control animals. Of note, oral treatment with B. fragilis strain ZY-312 ameliorated AAD-related diarrhea symptoms by increasing the abundance of specific commensal microbiota. Interestingly, we demonstrated that these changes were coincident with the restoration of intestinal barrier function and enterocyte regeneration in AAD rats. In summary, we identified a potential probiotic therapeutic strategy for AAD and identified the vital roles of B. fragilis strain ZY-312 in modulating the colonic bacterial community and participating in microbiota-mediated epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation. © 2018 Zhang, Zhu, Xu, Liu, Qiu, Li, Li, He, Zhou, Bai and Zhi.",30.0

However, recent studies have shown that some lactic acid bacteria produce toxic substances and display properties of virulence. To establish safety guidelines for lactic acid bacteria, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)/World Health Organization (WHO) has suggested that lactic acid bacteria be characterized and proven safe for consumers’ health via multiple experiments (e.g., antibiotic resistance, metabolic activity, toxin production, hemolytic activity, infectivity in immune-compromised animal species, human side effects, and adverse-outcome analyses). Among the lactic acid bacteria, Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus species are probiotic strains that are most commonly commercially produced and actively studied. Bifidobacterium bifidum BGN4 and Bifidobacterium longum BORI have been used in global functional food markets (e.g., China, Germany, Jordan, Korea, Lithuania, New Zealand, Poland, Singapore, Thailand, Turkey, and Vietnam) as nutraceutical ingredients for decades, without any adverse events. However, given that the safety of some newly screened probiotic species has recently been debated, it is crucial that the consumer safety of each commercially utilized strain be confirmed. Accordingly, this paper details a safety assessment of B. bifidum BGN4 and B. longum BORI via the assessment of ammonia production, hemolysis of blood cells, biogenic amine production, antimicrobial susceptibility pattern, antibiotic resistance gene transferability, PCR data on antibiotic resistance genes, mucin degradation, genome stability, and possession of virulence factors. These probiotic strains showed neither hemolytic activity nor mucin degradation activity, and they did not produce ammonia or biogenic amines (i.e., cadaverine, histamine or tyramine). B. bifidum BGN4 and B. longum BORI produced a small amount of putrescine, commonly found in living cells, at levels similar to or lower than that found in other foods (e.g., spinach, ketchup, green pea, sauerkraut, and sausage). B. bifidum BGN4 showed higher resistance to gentamicin than the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) cut-off. However, this paper shows the gentamicin resistance of B. bifidum BGN4 was not transferred via conjugation with L. acidophilus ATCC 4356, the latter of which is highly susceptible to gentamicin. The entire genomic sequence of B. bifidum BGN4 has been published in GenBank (accession no.: CP001361.1), documenting the lack of retention of plasmids capable of transferring an antibiotic-resistant gene. Moreover, there was little genetic mutation between the first and 25th generations of B. bifidum BGN4. Tetracycline-resistant genes are prevalent among B. longum strains; B. longum BORI has a tet(W) gene on its chromosome DNA and has also shown resistance to tetracycline. However, this research shows that its tetracycline resistance was not transferred via conjugation with L. fermentum AGBG1, the latter of which is highly sensitive to tetracycline. These findings support the continuous use of B. bifidum BGN4 and B. longum BORI as probiotics, both of which have been reported as safe by several clinical studies, and have been used in food supplements for many years. © 2018 by the authors.

The bacterial community was analyzed following high-throughput pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes, and the fecal concentrations of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were measured by gas chromatograph. Our results showed that Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were the dominant phyla, and Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Clostridium, SMB53, and Bifidobacterium were the most abundant genera. Fifteen predominant genera present in every Jinhua pig sample constituted a phylogenetic core microbiota and included the probiotics Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, and the SCFA-producing bacteria Clostridium, Prevotella, Bacteroides, Coprococcus, Roseburia, Ruminococcus, Blautia, and Butyricicoccus. Comparisons of the microbiota compositions and SCFA concentrations across the 6 groups of pigs demonstrated that genetic background and weaning age affected the structure of the gut microbiota more significantly than the farm. The relative abundance of the core genera in the pigs, including Lactobacillus, Clostridium, Prevotella, Bacteroides, Roseburia, Ruminococcus, Blautia, and Butyricicoccus varied dramatically in pigs among the 2 origins and 3 weaning ages, while Oscillospira, Megasphaera, Parabacteroides, and Corynebacterium differed among pigs from different farms. Interestingly, there was a more significant influence of strain and weaning age than of rearing farm on the SCFA concentrations. Therefore, strain and weaning age appear to be the more important factors shaping the intestinal microbiome of pigs. © 2018, The Microbiological Society of Korea and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",25.0

Here, we investigated the effect of a 3-months lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet on the diversity of gut microbiota and the immune system in healthy omnivorous volunteers, using high-throughput sequencing technologies. The short-term vegetarian diet did not have any major effect on the diversity of the immune system and the overall composition of the metagenome. The prevalence of bacterial genera/species with known beneficial effects on the intestine, including butyrate-producers and probiotic species and the balance of autoimmune-related variable genes/families were, however, altered in the short-term vegetarians. A number of bacterial species that are associated with the expression level of IgA, a key immunoglobulin class that protects the gastrointestinal mucosal system, were also identified. Furthermore, a lower diversity of T-cell repertoire and expression level of IgE, as well as a reduced abundance of inflammation-related genes in the gut microbiota were potentially associated with a control group with long-term vegetarians. Thus, the composition and duration of the diet may have an impact on the balance of pro-/anti-inflammatory factors in the gut microbiota and immune system. © 2018 Zhang, Björkman, Cai, Liu, Wang, Li, Xia, Sun, Kristiansen, Wang, Han, Hammarström and Pan-Hammarström.",17.0

The adult parasite mainly inhabits the bile duct and gall bladder, and results in various complications to the hepatobiliary system. The amount of bile secreted into the intestine is reduced in cases of C. sinensis infection, which may alter the pH of the gut and decrease the amount of surfactant protein D released from the gallbladder. However, the impact of parasitic infection on the human gut microbiome remains unclear. To this end, we examined the gut microbiota composition in 47 modified Kato–Katz thick smear-positive (egg-positive) volunteers and 42 healthy controls from five rural communities. Subjects were grouped into four sub-populations based on age and infection status. High-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed significant changes in alpha diversity between EP1 and EN1. The beta diversity showed alterations between C. sinensis-infected subjects and healthy controls. In C. sinensis infected patients, we found the significant reduction of certain taxa, such as Bacteroides and anti-inflammatory Bifidobacterium (P < 0.05). Bacteroides, a predominant gut bacteria in healthy populations, was negatively correlated with the number of C. sinensis eggs per gram (EPG, r = −0.37, P adjust < 0.01 in 20–60 years old group; r = −0.64, P adjust = 0.04 in the 60+ years old group). What’s more, the reduction in the abundance of Bifidobacterium, a common probiotic, was decreased particularly in the 60 + years old group (r = −0.50, P = 0.04). The abundance of Dorea, a potentially pro-inflammatory microbe, was higher in infected subjects than in healthy individuals (P < 0.05). Variovorax was a unique bacteria that was only detected in infected subjects. These results clearly demonstrate the significant influence of C. sinensis infection on the human gut microbiota and provided new insights into the control, prevention, diagnosis, and clinical study of clonorchiasis through the human gut microbiota. © Copyright © 2018 Xu, Jiang, Huang, Yin, Ou, Jiang, Meng, Cao, Yu, Cao and Shen.",13.0

Antibiotics remain the first-line therapy for C. difficile-associated diseases (CDAD), despite the risks of resistance promotion and further gut microbiota perturbation. Notably, the abundance of Bacteroides fragilis was reported to be significantly decreased in CDAD patients. This study aimed to clarify the prophylactic effects of B. fragilis strain ZY-312 in a mouse model of C. difficile infection (CDI). The CDI mouse model was successfully created using C. difficile strain VPI 10463 spores, as confirmed by lethal diarrhea (12.5% survival rate), serious gut barrier disruption, and microbiota disruption. CDI model mice prophylactically treated with B. fragilis exhibited significantly higher survival rates (100% in low dosage group, 87.5% in high dosage group) and improved clinical manifestations. Histopathological analysis of colon and cecum tissue samples revealed an intact gut barrier with strong ZO-1 and Muc-2 expression. The bacterial diversity and relative abundance of gut microbiota were significantly improved. Interestingly, the relative abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila was positively correlated with B. fragilis treatment. In vitro experiments showed that B. fragilis inhibited C. difficile adherence, and attenuated the decrease in CDI-induced transepithelial electrical resistance, ZO-1 and MUC-2 loss, and apoptosis, suggesting that B. fragilis protected against CDI possibly by resisting pathogen colonization and improving gut barrier integrity and functions. In summary, B. fragilis exerted protective effects on a CDI mouse model by modulating gut microbiota and alleviating barrier destruction, thereby relieving epithelial stress and pathogenic colitis triggered by C. difficile. This study provides an alternative preventative measure for CDI and lays the foundations for further investigations of the relationships among opportunistic pathogens, commensal microbiota, and the gut barrier. © Copyright © 2018 Deng, Yang, Zhang, Qian, Zhang, Liu, Wang, Bai, Fan, Zhao and Zhi.",40.0

Methods and Results: Administration of the antibiotic ampicillin for 2 weeks decreased microbial community diversity, induced caecum tumefaction and increased gut permeability in mice. Application of a probiotic cocktail of four Lactobacillus species (JUP-Y4) modulated the microbiota community structure and promoted the abundance of potentially beneficial bacteria such as Akkermansia. Ampicillin administration led to a decline in Bacteroidetes from 46·6 ± 3·91% to 0·264 ± 0·0362%; the addition of JUP-Y4 restored this to 41·4 ± 2·87%. This probiotic supplementation was more effective than natural restoration, where the levels of Bacteroidetes were only restored to 29·3 ± 2·07%. Interestingly, JUP-Y4 treatment was more effective in the restoration of microbiota in faecal samples than in caecal samples. JUP-Y4 also significantly reduced the levels of d-lactate and endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) in the serum of mice, and increased the expression of tight-junction proteins while reducing the production of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, MCP-1, IFN-γ and IL-1β) in the ileum and the colon of antibiotic-treated mice. Conclusions: JUP-Y4 not only promoted recovery from antibiotic-induced gut dysbiosis, but also enhanced the function of the gut barrier, reduced inflammation and lowered levels of circulating endotoxin in mice.

We have previously shown that eight weeks of walnut consumption (43 g/day) significantly improves lipids in healthy subjects. In the same study, gut microbiome was evaluated. We included 194 healthy subjects (134 females, 63 ± 7 years, BMI 25.1 ± 4.0 kg/m2) in a randomized, controlled, prospective, cross-over study. Following a nut-free run-in period, subjects were randomized to two diet phases (eight weeks each); 96 subjects first followed a walnut-enriched diet (43 g/day) and then switched to a nut-free diet, while 98 subjects followed the diets in reverse order. While consuming the walnut-enriched diet, subjects were advised to either reduce fat or carbohydrates or both to account for the additional calories. Fecal samples were collected from 135 subjects at the end of the walnut-diet and the control-diet period for microbiome analyses. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing data was clustered with a 97% similarity into Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs). UniFrac distances were used to determine diversity between groups. Differential abundance was evaluated using the Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test. All analyses were performed using Rhea. Generalized UniFrac distance shows that walnut consumption significantly affects microbiome composition and diversity. Multidimensional scaling (metric and non-metric) indicates dissimilarities of approximately 5% between walnut and control (p = 0.02). The abundance of Ruminococcaceae and Bifidobacteria increased significantly (p &lt; 0.02) while Clostridium sp. cluster XIVa species (Blautia; Anaerostipes) decreased significantly (p &lt; 0.05) during walnut consumption. The effect of walnut consumption on the microbiome only marginally depended on whether subjects replaced fat, carbohydrates or both while on walnuts. Daily intake of 43 g walnuts over eight weeks significantly affects the gut microbiome by enhancing probioticand butyric acid-producing species in healthy individuals. Further evaluation is required to establish whether these changes are preserved during longer walnut consumption and how these are linked to the observed changes in lipid metabolism. © 2018 by the authors.

Overlapping symptoms with the acute presentation of d-lactic acidosis has prompted the use of antibiotic treatment to target the overgrowth of species within the Streptococcus genus found in commensal enteric microbiota as a possible treatment for neurological symptoms in ME/CFS. Methods: An open-label, repeated measures design was used to examine treatment efficacy and enable sex comparisons. Participants included 44 adult ME/CFS patients (27 females) from one specialist medical clinic with Streptococcus viable counts above 3.00 × 10 5 cfu/g (wet weight of faeces) and with a count greater than 5% of the total count of aerobic microorganisms. The 4-week treatment protocol included alternate weeks of Erythromycin (400 mg of erythromycin as ethyl succinate salt) twice daily and probiotic (d-lactate free multistrain probiotic, 5 × 10 10 cfu twice daily). 2 × 2 repeated measures ANOVAs were used to assess sex-time interactions and effects across pre- and post-intervention for microbial, lactate and clinical outcomes. Ancillary non-parametric correlations were conducted to examine interactions between change in microbiota and clinical outcomes. Results: Large treatment effects were observed for the intention-to-treat sample with a reduction in Streptococcus viable count and improvement on several clinical outcomes including total symptoms, some sleep (less awakenings, greater efficiency and quality) and cognitive symptoms (attention, processing speed, cognitive flexibility, story memory and verbal fluency). Mood, fatigue and urine d:l lactate ratio remained similar across time. Ancillary results infer that shifts in microbiota were associated with more of the variance in clinical changes for males compared with females. Conclusions: Results support the notion that specific microorganisms interact with some ME/CFS symptoms and offer promise for the therapeutic potential of targeting gut dysbiosis in this population. Streptococcus spp. are not the primary or sole producers of d-lactate. Further investigation of lactate concentrations are needed to elucidate any role of d-lactate in this population. Concurrent microbial shifts that may be associated with clinical improvement (i.e., increased Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium or decreased Clostridium in males) invite enquiry into alternative strategies for individualised treatment. © 2018 The Author(s).",11.0

The composition of gut microbiota (total microbes residing in the gut) impacts on cholesterol and lipid metabolism. On the contrary, alterations in gut microbiota in response to hypercholesterolemia or drug treatment with atorvastatin (a cholesterol-lowering agent) are rarely investigated. We performed 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing to evaluate the gut bacterial community of 15 untreated hypercholesterolemic patients (HP) and 27 atorvastatin-treated hypercholesterolemic patients (At-HP) and compared with 19 healthy subjects (HS). In total, 18 different phyla were identified in the study groups. An increase in relative abundance of Proteobacteria was observed in the HP group compared with At-HP and HS groups. The atherosclerosis-associated genus Collinsella was found at relatively higher abundance in the HP group. The anti-inflammation-associated bacteria (Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Akkermansia muciniphila, and genus Oscillospira) were found in greater abundance, and proinflammatory species Desulfovibrio sp. was observed at decreased abundance in the drug-treated HP group compared with the untreated HP group. Relative abundances of the Bilophila wadsworthia and Bifidobacterium bifidum (bile acid-associated species) were decreased in the At-HP group. The At-HP and HS clustered separately from HP in the principal coordinate analysis. Decreased bacterial diversity was observed in the atorvastatin-treated group. In conclusion, these data suggest that atorvastatin treatment of patients with hypercholesterolemia may selectively restore the relative abundance of several dominant and functionally important taxa that were disrupted in the HP. Further studies are required to investigate the putative modifying effects of hypocholesterolemic drugs on functionality of gut microbiota, and the potential downstream effects on human health. © Copyright 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2018.",32.0

The results showed that the weight gain rate, survival rate, hepatosomatic index, organ coefficient and condition factor were not significantly different among the groups, except intraperitoneal fat ratio was significantly reduced in 0.2% BYH group. Totally 25 phyla, 56 classes, 103 orders, 155 families, 216 genera and 1051 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of bacteria were identified from the 2,057,871 sequences obtained by Illumina MiSeq 16S rRNA sequencing. Among them, Fusobacteria, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were the most three dominant phyla in the intestines regardless of diets. Furthermore, the richness of Fusobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Tenericutes and Actinobacteria in 0.2% BYH group was significantly lower than those of the control group. Interestingly, the ratio of Bacteroides/Firmicutes was decreased in the groups fed with BYH, this might be related to the modulations of energy absorption and storage, resulting in the decrease of fat deposition in fish body. At the genus level, several bacterial genera (Plesiomonas, Mycoplasmas, Synechococcus and Peptostreptococcus) which were potential pathogens of fish were significantly decreased in the groups fed with BYH. By contrast, a significant increase of Cetobacterium which could ferment peptides and carbohydrates to produce vitamin B12 was observed in fish fed with BYH, indicating that dietary BYH was helpful in propagation of some probiotic bacteria. Taken together, the overall intestinal bacterial diversity was decreased in fish fed with BYH which might promote the growth of some probiotics and inhibit some pathogenic bacteria, suggesting that BYH may serve as feed additive in modulation of the gut bacterial community of largemouth bass to decrease the potential pathogens. © 2017",45.0

The specific growth rate of indigenous L. plantarum in lactulose (0.51/hr) was found to be maximum followed by fructooligosaccharide (0.34/hr) and inulin (0.18/hr) which was statistically at par with reference strain. Shortest mean doubling time of indigenous strain was observed with lactulose (1 hr 35 min) followed by fructooligosaccharide (2 hr 3 min), and inulin (3 hr 85 min). Lactic and short-chain fatty acids namely, acetic, propionic, and butyric were the principle metabolites observed after fermentation of prebiotics as detected by ultra-performance liquid chromatography analysis. No significant change in growth and pH of anaerobic pathogens was observed in medium supplemented with different prebiotics. Presence of lactulose showed maximum inhibition in adherence of anaerobic pathogens namely, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (39 and 37%), Clostridium perfringens (36 and 34%), and Bacteroides fragilis (18 and16%), to Caco-2 and HT-29 intestinal cell lines. Practical applications: The ability of certain bacteria to ferment prebiotics selectively is an important probiotic characteristic. According to the results of this study, lactulose was found to be the promising ingredient in combination with indigenous strain that not only supported the growth of lactobacillus strain, but also inhibited the adherence of anaerobic pathogens to intestinal cell lines. The metabolites produced on fermentation of prebiotic such as lactate, acetate, propionate, and butyrate have many reported health benefits in boosting the gut immunity of the host. Negligible growth of anaerobic pathogens in lactulose indicating its safe use without any ill effect to the host. Thus, the lactulose might have a potential for practical use in food industry for the development of future functional and dietary foods to impart health benefits at both colonic and systemic levels. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",10.0

However, currently there has been no evidence regarding the cellular mechanisms involved in the probiotic effects of LAB on human immune cells. Here, we demonstrated that LAB double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) triggered interferon-β (IFN-β) production by human dendritic cells (DCs), which activated IFN-γ-producing T cells. Interleukin-12 (IL-12) secretion from human DCs in response to LAB was abrogated by depletion of bacterial dsRNA, and was attenuated by neutralizing IFN-β, indicating LAB dsRNA primarily activated the IFN-β/IL-12 pathway. Moreover, the induction of IL-12 secretion from DCs by LAB was abolished by the inhibition of endosomal acidification, confirming the critical role of the endosomal digestion of LAB. In a coculture of human naïve CD4+ T cells and BDCA1+ DCs, DCs stimulated with LAB containing dsRNA induced IFN-γ-producing T cells. These results indicate that human DCs activated by LAB enhance Th1 immunity depending on IFN-β secretion in response to bacterial dsRNA. © 2018 Kawashima, Ikari, Watanabe, Kubota, Yoshio, Kanto, Motohashi, Shimojo and Tsuji.",10.0

Postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) usually manifests itself as the diarrhea-predominant subtype. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth has been observed more frequently in patients with IBS compared to healthy controls. However, the pathophysiology of IBS is not fully understood, and based on recent evidences, altered gut microbiota is involved in the pathogenesis of IBS. Therefore, we aimed to compare the microbiome in hospitalized patients with diarrhea and healthy individuals. Thirty patients and 10 healthy controls were included into this case–control study. Microbial count was performed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction method using bacterial 16S rRNA gene. Clostridium cluster IV and Bacteroides were significantly more frequent in the patients compared with the healthy individuals (p = 0.02 and 0.023, respectively). However, the quantity of Enterococcus and Bifidobacterium groups were significantly higher in healthy controls than in diarrheal group (p = 0.000076 and 0.001, respectively). The results showed that the number of bacteria in all bacterial groups was significantly different between healthy individuals and diabetic group, whereas the difference between the healthy group and IBS was not significant for Bifidobacterium group. The findings of this study outlined the relationship between diarrhea, IBS, and diabetes disease and bacterial composition.

It was found that after taking different probiotics intestinal microbiota changed in a strain-specific manner. The maximal activity against pathogens was revealed after the administration of a mixture of bacterial strains under study or a single strain of enterococci. The strain E. faecium L3 showed the most activity against both Klebsiella spp. and Bacteroides fragilis. It helped to restore the original content of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. The number of Klebsiella spp. was the same in the group receiving L. rhamnosus K32 and the group of animals, which was not consuming probiotics. Different probiotic strains included in the composition had various immunological effects. Probiotic bifidobacteria, enterococci and the mixture of three probiotics stimulated of mRNA expression of interleukin (IL)-10 in mesenteric lymph nodes. The changes in microbiota after consuming an enterococcal probiotic correlated with an increase in transforming growth factor (TGF)-β and IL-10 content in blood serum and an increase of the intestinal mucus layer. Consumption of L. rhamnosus K32 led to the stimulation of IL-8 expression in mesenteric lymph nodes.

Some non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) are defined as prebiotics and oats being one of richest sources of NSP in grains are considered as potentially having prebiotic effect. However, information on fermentation of specific NSP of oats is limited. Moreover, bacterial cross-feeding interactions in which fermentation of prebiotics is involved is poorly characterized. Here, we report the exploration of new candidates for the syntrophic bacterial interactions and fermentability of oat non-starch polysaccharides (NSP). The results obtained by differentiating composition, viscosity and concentration of oats NSP in fermentation medium showed that Bacillus licheniformis pre-digests oat NSP, degrades high viscosity of oat β-glucan and makes hemicellulose easier to access for other bacteria. Because of fermentation, B. licheniformis produces lactic and succinic acids, which further can be used by other bacteria for cross-feeding and SCFA production. © 2018 Vanda Sargautiene et al.",6.0

Antibiotic-associated gastrointestinal signs (AAGS) occur commonly in cats. Co-administration of synbiotics is associated with decreased AAGS in people, potentially due to stabilization of the fecal microbiome and metabolome. The purpose of this double-blinded randomized-controlled trial was to compare AAGS and the fecal microbiome and metabolome between healthy cats that received clindamycin with a placebo or synbiotic. Methods. 16 healthy domestic shorthair cats from a research colony were randomized to receive 150 mg clindamycin with either a placebo (eight cats) or commercially- available synbiotic (eight cats) once daily for 21 days with reevaluation 603 days thereafter. All cats ate the same diet. Food consumption, vomiting, and fecal score were recorded. Fecal samples were collected daily on the last three days of baseline (days 5-7), treatment (26-28), and recovery (631-633). Sequencing of 16S rRNA genes and gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry was performed. Clinical signs, alpha and beta diversity metrics, dysbiosis indices, proportions of bacteria groups, and metabolite profiles were compared between treatment groups using repeated measures ANOVAs. Fecal metabolite pathway analysis was performed. P < 0:05 was considered significant. The Benjamini & Hochberg's False Discovery Rate was used to adjust for multiple comparisons. Results. Median age was six and five years, respectively, for cats in the placebo and synbiotic groups. Hyporexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or some combination therein were induced in all cats. Though vomiting was less in cats receiving a synbiotic, the difference was not statistically significant. Bacterial diversity decreased significantly on days 26-28 in both treatment groups. Decreases in Actinobacteria (Bifidobacterium, Collinsella, Slackia), Bacteriodetes (Bacteroides), Lachnospiraceae (Blautia, Coprococcus, Roseburia), Ruminococcaceae (Faecilobacterium, Ruminococcus), and Erysipelotrichaceae (Bulleidia, [Eubacterium]) and increases in Clostridiaceae (Clostridium) and Proteobac- teria (Aeromonadales, Enterobacteriaceae) occurred in both treatment groups, with incomplete normalization by days 631-633. Derangements in short-chain fatty acid, bile acid, indole, sphingolipid, benzoic acid, cinnaminic acid, and polyamine profiles also occurred, some of which persisted through the terminal sampling timepoint and differed between treatment groups. Discussion. Cats administered clindamycin commonly develop AAGS, as well as short- and long-term dysbiosis and alterations in fecal metabolites. Despite a lack of differences in clinical signs between treatment groups, significant differences in their fecal metabolomic profiles were identified. Further investigation is warranted to determine whether antibiotic-induced dysbiosis is associated with an increased risk of future AAGS or metabolic diseases in cats and whether synbiotic administration ameliorates this risk. © 2018 Whittemore et al.",10.0

Current use of probiotics is aimed at modulating the bacterial gut composition to alleviate specific diseases. The safety and tolerance of three probiotic strains (Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis R0033, Lactobacillus helveticus R0052 and Bifidobacterium bifidum R0071) has recently been described. The objective of the present study was to analyse the microbiological composition and immunological parameters of faecal samples obtained from healthy infants from 3 to 12 months of age after receiving either one of the three probiotic strains or placebo for 8 weeks. 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing and multiplexing technology was used for analysis. Faecal sample analysis showed that the most abundant genus in all four groups of infants pre- and post-intervention was Bifidobacterium, representing approximately 50% of the sequences. After the intervention period the microbial composition of faecal samples in the probiotic groups did not display notable changes. In contrast, a decrease in different Bifidobacterium species, such as B. bifidum and Bifidobacterium breve and an increase in Bacteroides, Blautia, Clostridium, Coprococcus and Faecalibacterium genera was observed in the placebo group. The analysis of a wide range of immune factors in faecal samples suggests a modulatory effect by these three probiotic strains during the intervention period. The anti-inflammatory ratio interleukin (IL)-10/IL-12 increased at the end of the intervention period in the B. infantis R0033 group while the TNF-α/IL-10 ratio increased in the L. helveticus R0052 group. The decrease of the IL-10/IL-12 ratio together with the increase of the tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α)/IL-10 ratio demonstrated a pro-inflammatory profile in the placebo group. In conclusion, the species profile of the microbiome observed in all three probiotic groups resembled that of a younger infant, similar to an unweaned infant, when compared to the placebo group which may also be related with an anti-inflammatory effect. © 2018 Wageningen Academic Publishers.",20.0

The aim of this study was to determine the composition of the mucus microbiota in the human ileum and to assess the effects of oral administration of synbiotics on the microbiota. Methods: As part of a clinical trial for synbiotics treatment and surgical infection, ileal mucus was sampled when resection of the ileocecal portion was required. The microbiota composition was examined using 16S rRNA-targeted real-time-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Results: A total of 33 samples from the synbiotics group and 39 from the control group were analyzed. Total numbers of bacteria in the ileum were 108.5 cells/g in the synbiotics group and 108.4 cells/g in the control group, in which obligate anaerobes were dominant over facultative anaerobes. The level of Enterobacteriaceae was significantly lower in the synbiotics group than in the control group. The administered probiotics species Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota and Bifidobacterium breve strain Yakult were detected in 42 and 76 per cent of the synbiotics group, respectively. No significant correlations were observed between tumour stage/size and the various microbes present, except for a negative correlation between tumour size and Bifidobacterium.

Compared with the model group, the general relative indices results showed L. plantarum ZDY2013 and B. bifidum WBIN03 have a significant effect on DSS-induced UC in mice, by downregulating the pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-α) and upregulating antioxidant factors (e.g., SOD1, SOD2, GPX2) at the transcriptional level. By means of high-throughput sequencing (16S V3–V4) and systematical bioinformatics analyses, we found that colitis may be associated with the changes in intestinal flora, especially Firmicutes and Bacteroides.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Bifidobacterium sp. MKK4 and rice-based fermented foods on physical, haematological, gut microbiota and lypogenic-lypolytic marker genes in diet-induced obese mice. Adult male mice (21±0.7 g) were randomly divided into four groups (n=10) according to the type of diet: normal diet (ND), high fat diet (HFD), HFD supplemented with Bifidobacterium sp. MKK4 and HFD supplemented with MKK4 associated rice-fermented food. 8 weeks of bacterial therapy in the obese mice resulted in significant reduction of body and organ weights, improved serum levels of glucose, triglyceride and cholesterol, the histological structure of the liver (steatosis), and re-establishment of gut Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides species. The bacterial therapy led to up-regulation of lipolytic transcription factors, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-α, PPAR-σ, and their regulated gene products in fatty acid metabolism and glucose uptake, such as acyl-CoA oxidase, carnitine palmitoyl-transferase-1, uncoupling protein-3 and glucose transporter-4. Concomitantly, both adipocytogenesis and fatty acid synthesis were arrested as reflected by the down-regulation of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, fatty acid synthase and tumour necrosis factor alpha genes.

In longitudinal studies, only identifying differential features between two phenotypes does not provide sufficient information to determine whether a change in the relative abundance is short-term or continuous. Furthermore, sample collection in longitudinal studies suffers from all forms of variability such as a different number of subjects per phenotypic group, a different number of samples per subject, and samples not collected at consistent time points. These inconsistencies are common in studies that collect samples from human subjects. Results: We present MetaLonDA, an R package that is capable of identifying significant time intervals of differentially abundant microbial features. MetaLonDA is flexible such that it can perform differential abundance tests despite inconsistencies associated with sample collection. Extensive experiments on simulated datasets quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of MetaLonDA with significant improvement over alternative methods. We applied MetaLonDA to the DIABIMMUNE cohort (https://pubs.broadinstitute.org/diabimmune) substantiating significant early lifetime intervals of exposure to Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium in Finnish and Russian infants. Additionally, we established significant time intervals during which novel differentially relative abundant microbial genera may contribute to aberrant immunogenicity and development of autoimmune disease. Conclusion: MetaLonDA is computationally efficient and can be run on desktop machines. The identified differentially abundant features and their time intervals have the potential to distinguish microbial biomarkers that may be used for microbial reconstitution through bacteriotherapy, probiotics, or antibiotics. Moreover, MetaLonDA can be applied to any longitudinal count data such as metagenomic sequencing, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, or RNAseq.

"Zhang Q., Yu H., Xiao X., Hu L., Xin F., Yu X.",Inulin-type fructan improves diabetic phenotype and gut microbiota profiles in rats,2018,PeerJ,10.7717/peerj.4446,"Background & Aims. Accumulating research has addressed the linkage between the changes to gut microbiota structure and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Inulin is one type of soluble dietary fiber that can alleviate T2D. As a prebiotic, inulin cannot be digested by humans, but rather is digested by probiotics. However, whether inulin treatment can benefit the entire gut bacteria community remains unknown. In this study, we evaluated the differences in gut microbiota composition among diabetic, inulin-treated diabetic, normal control, and inulin-treated normal control rats. Methods. A diabetic rat model was generated by a high-fat diet and streptozotocin injections (HF/STZ). Inulin was orally administered to normal and diabetic rats. To determine the composition of the gut microbiota, fecal DNA extraction and 16S rRNA gene 454 pyrosequencing were performed. Results. We found that inulin treatment reduced fasting blood glucose levels and alleviated glucose intolerance and blood lipid panels in diabetic rats. Additionally, inulin treatment increased the serum glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) level, reduced serum IL-6 level, Il6 expression in epididymal adipose tissue, and Pepck, G6pc expression in liver of diabetic rats. Pyrophosphate sequencing of the 16s V3-V4 region demonstrated an elevated proportion of Firmicutes and a reduced abundance of Bacteroidetes at the phylogenetic level in diabetic rats compared to normal control rats. The characteristics of the gut microbiota in control and inulin-treated rats were similar. Inulin treatment can normalize the composition of the gut microbiota in diabetic rats. At the family and genus levels, probiotic bacteria Lactobacillus and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)- producing bacteria Lachnospiraceae, Phascolarctobacterium, and Bacteroides were found to be significantly more abundant in the inulin-treated diabetic group than in the non- treated diabetic group. In addition, inulin-treated rats had a lower abundance of Desul- fovibrio, which produce lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The abundance of Lachnospiraceae was negatively correlated with the blood glucose response after a glucose load. Conclusion. In summary, diabetic rats have different gut microbiota from control rats. Inulin treatment can alleviate gut microbiota dysbiosis in T2D model rats. Moreover, inulin treatment enhanced serum GLP-1 level to suppress IL-6 secretion and production and hepatic gluconeogenesis, resulted in moderation of insulin tolerance. © 2018 Zhang et al.",85.0

The DMF included seven gut commensal species of porcine origin that mimic the predominant species in the infant gut. Gn piglets were divided into four groups: DMF control (non-treated), DMF+CIP (CIP treated), DMF+CIP+EcN (CIP/EcN treated), DMF+EcN (EcN treated) and inoculated orally with 105 cfu of each DMF strain. The pig gut was successfully colonised by all DMF species and established a simplified bacterial community by post-bacteria colonisation day (PBCD) 14/post-VirHRV challenge day (PCD) 0. Overall, Bifidobacterium adolescentis was commonly observed in faeces in all groups and time points. At PCD0, after six days of CIP treatment (DMF+CIP), we observed significantly decreased aerobic and anaerobic bacteria counts especially in jejunum (P &lt; 0.001), where no DMF species were detected in jejunum by T-RFLP. Following HRV challenge, 100% of pigs in DMF+CIP group developed diarrhoea with higher diarrhoea scores and duration as compared to all other groups. However, only 33% of pigs treated with EcN plus CIP developed diarrhoea. EcN treatment also enhanced the bacterial diversity and all seven DMF species were detected with a higher proportion of Bifidobacterium longum in jejunum in the DMF+CIP+EcN group on PBCD14/PCD0. Our results suggest that EcN increased the proportion of B. longum especially in jejunum and mitigated adverse impacts of antibiotic use during acute-infectious diarrhoea.

Diabetic male rats were injected subcutaneously with a low dose of liraglutide (liraglutide 0.2 mg/kg/day), a high dose of liraglutide (liraglutide 0.4 mg/kg/day), or normal saline for 12 weeks. Our data showed that liraglutide effectively prevented the development of diabetes in male rats. Pyrosequencing of the V3-V4 region of 16S rRNA genes manifested a remarkable transfer of gut microbiota construction in liraglutide-treated male rats compared with that of the diabetic male rats. Further analysis identified 879 liraglutide-treated specific operational taxonomic units. Some short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria, including Bacteroides, Lachnospiraceae, and probiotic bacteria, Bifidobacterium, were selectively enhanced in liraglutide-treated diabetic male rats. Lactobacillus was negatively correlated with fasting blood glucose. To sum up, our findings propose that the prevention of diabetes by liraglutide in the diabetic male rats may be associated with the structural change of the gut microbiota, inflammation alleviation, and abundantly elevated SCFA-producing bacteria in the intestine. Impact statement: Our findings suggest that significant changes in gut microbiota are associated with liraglutide treatment on the diabetic male rats, including enrichment of short-chain fatty acid producers and probiotic bacteria. This may help alleviate systemic inflammation and contribute to the beneficial effects of liraglutide against diabetes. © 2017, © 2017 by the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.",29.0

One-day old Ross 308 chicks were assigned to 36 pens with 22 birds/pen and 6 pens/treatment (Experiment 1) or 36 cages with 8 birds/cage and 6 cages/treatment (Experiment 2). Treatment additives were added to nutritionally complete corn/soy based starter (d 1 to 21) and finisher (d 22 to 42) diets. Treatments included 1) a control diet containing 500 FTU/kg phytase (CTL), 2) CTL + xylanase (2,000 U/kg) and amylase (200 U/kg; XA), 3) CTL+XA + protease (4000 U/g; XAP), 4) CTL+DFM (150,000 cfu/g of 3 strains of Bacillus spp), 5) CTL+DFM+XA, and 6) CTL+DFM+XAP. Supplementation with DFM increased BW, BWG, and FI compared with the CTL (P < 0.05); XAP, but not XA, resulted in increased final BW, BWG and FI compared to the control (P < 0.05). XA and XAP improved apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of starch and fat on d 22 to 42 with XAP improving AMEn (by ∼82 kcal) compared with CTL birds (P < 0.01). DFM+XAP improved apparent ileal digestible energy (AIDE), AID of fat and starch on d 22 to 42, and additionally had a greater than additive effect on AIDE and AMEn. Supplementation with DFM+XAP reduced the ileal and total tract flow of insoluble arabinose and additionally total tract flow of soluble and insoluble xylose and total galactose (P < 0.05); similar effects of XA+DFM were not seen or were lower in magnitude, suggesting that the protease component plays an important role in increasing the availability of NSP for hydrolysis. Supplementation with DFM alone did not affect gut bacterial populations, but XA and XAP reduced numbers of Campylobacter species (by > 2.5 log cfu/g; P < 0.001) and Bacteroides (P < 0.02) in the cecum compared with CTL birds. © 2017 Poultry Science Association Inc.",26.0

Methods and Results: Healthy students (21 males and 11 females) took paraprobiotic CP2305 daily for 5 weeks during a cadaver dissection course. The General Health Questionnaire and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index were employed to assess stress-related somatic symptoms and sleep quality respectively. The aggravation of stress-associated somatic symptoms was observed in female students (P = 0·029). Sleep quality was improved in the paraprobiotic CP2305 group (P = 0·038), particularly in men (P = 0·004). Among men, paraprobiotic CP2305 shortened sleep latency (P = 0·035) and increased sleep duration (P = 0·048). Diarrhoea-like symptoms were also effectively controlled with CP2305 (P = 0·005) in men. Thus, we observed sex-related differences in the effects of paraprobiotic CP2305. In addition, CP2305 affected the growth of faecal Bacteroides vulgatus and Dorea longicatena, which are involved in intestinal inflammation. Conclusions: CP2305 is a potential paraprobiotic that regulates stress responses, and its beneficial effects may depend on specific cell component(s).

Oral administration of probiotic and prebiotic foods strengthens the beneficial symbiont populations in the gut and may prevent immune-mediated destruction of pancreatic β-cells. The present study was designed to elucidate the gut microbiome of diabetic rats supplemented with a Lactobacillus probiotic and a Saccharomyces cerevisiae (SC) cell wall prebiotic. Diabetes mellitus was induced in male Wistar rats with allaxon monohydrate (150 mg/kg). The rats were fed chow maintenance diet (control and diabetic control groups) or the same diet supplemented with a SC prebiotic (1 %), probiotic (multispecies Lactobacillus @108 CFU), or synbiotic. On d30, DNA was extracted from colon digesta for 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing. Serum was obtained to estimate total oxidant and anti-oxidant concentrations. A distinct clustering pattern (Unifrac distances, analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) P = 0.0361) was observed for the different treatment groups, with the main distinction consisting of the separation between the control and the diabetic control groups. Distinct bacterial clades dominated different treatment groups, particularly for the control and the diabetic control groups, though several bacterial groups overlapped, demonstrating a core microbiota dominated mainly by Firmicutes and Bacteroides. A trend of dysbiosis, characterized by low species richness, was observed in the diabetic rats, albeit not statistically significant. Serum oxidant and anti-oxidant concentrations were not different (P &gt; 0.05) among different treatment groups.

However, detailed information regarding the changes of microbiota after probiotics administration in relation to the gastrointestinal microbiota is absent. In the present study, dietary administration of putative probiotics Shewanella xiamenensis A-1, Aeromonas veronii A-7, and Bacillus subtilisstrains was conducted in grass carp to investigate if there is a discernible alteration in intestinal microbiota and whether the alteration is associated with previous study about the immunity regulation in grass carp. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequence-based comparisons of the bacterial communities in the grass carp intestine were detected after 28 days feeding by five diets, and results demonstrated the changes of microbial community composition at genus level. The abundance of Cetobacterium genus with potential immunity function increased. Potential pathogens and probiotics are important constitutions of the intestinal microbiota. Orally taken probiotics considerably reduced the abundance of the potential pathogenic bacteria (e.g., Pseudomonas and Flavobacterium genus) in the intestine. Meanwhile, putative probiotics used in this study were favorable to the reproduction of potential probiotics in THE intestine of grass carp (e.g., Vibrio, Streptococcus, and Enterococcus genus). Moreover, modulation of intestinal environment by the probiotics could impact the abundance of cellulose-degrading bacteria (e.g., Citrobacter genus). Those results suggested that oral probiotics administration can positively improve the composition of intestinal microbial community in grass carp, and this was associated with regulation of immunity in grass carp.

The impact of probioticsupplemented infant formula on the composition and function of the infant gut microbiota is not well defined. Objective: We sought to determine the effects of a bifidobacteriacontaining formula on the healthy human intestinal microbiome during the first year of life. Design: A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of newborn infants assigned to a standard whey-based formula containing a total of 107 colony-forming units (CFU)/g of Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium longum, B. longum subspecies infantis (intervention), or to a control formula without bifidobacteria (placebo). Breastfed controls were included. Diversity and composition of fecal microbiota were determined by 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing, and metabolite profiles were analyzed by ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry over a period of 2 y. Results: Infants (n = 106) were randomly assigned to either the interventional (n = 48) or placebo (n = 49) group; 9 infants were exclusively breastfed throughout the entire intervention period of 12 mo. Infants exposed to bifidobacteria-supplemented formula showed decreased occurrence of Bacteroides and Blautia spp. associated with changes in lipids and unknown metabolites at month 1. Microbiota and metabolite profiles of intervention and placebo groups converged during the study period, and long-term colonization (24 mo) of the supplemented Bifidobacterium strains was not detected. Significant differences in microbiota and metabolites were detected between infants fed breast milk and those fed formula (P < 0.005) and between infants birthed vaginally and those birthed by cesarean delivery (P < 0.005). No significant differences were observed between infant feeding groups regarding growth, antibiotic uptake, or other health variables (P > 0.05).

Our previous study demonstrated that Lactobacillus plantarum LP-O nl ly (LP) applied as a probiotic altered the gut fora and attenuated colitis in interleukin (IL)-10 knockout (IL-10-/-) mice. In the present study, metagenome sequencing was performed to investigate the gut microbiome in IL-10-/-mice and the influence of oral administration of LP on microbial composition. Metagenomics sequencing was performed to investigate the influence of IBD on the gut microbiome with and without LP treatment. The alteration of the abundances of various taxonomic and functional groups were investigated across these gut microbiomes. The present study demonstrates that Akkermansia muciniphila was significantly enriched in IL-10-/-mice, and bacteroides were significantly increased following LP administration. In addition, the phylum Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were significantly influenced by LP administration. Further characterization of functional capacity revealed that in the gut metagenomes of IL-10-/-mice, genes encoding cell cycle control, replication, recombination, repair and cell envelope biogenesis were decreased, but intracellular trafficking, secretion, and vesicular transport were increased.

Also, there is no study demonstrates the effect of ammonia exposure on gut microbial community of fish. In this study, crucian carp (Carassius auratus) were exposed to the ammonia concentrations, 0 (control), 10 mg L−1 (low) or 50 mg L−1 (high) for consecutive 30 days at 25 ± 1 °C temperature, respectively, and after that, the fish from all exposure groups were maintained in control conditions for another 15 days. The results showed that low concentration ammonia increased the expression of immune-related genes and antioxidant enzymes-related genes, but high concentration ammonia inhibited the expression of immune-related genes and antioxidant enzymes-related genes. After a 15-day treatment without ammonia, the expression of antioxidant enzymes-related genes and immune-related genes showed no significant changes compared with control. The results of high-throughput sequencing showed that gut microbial communities were significantly differentiated following ammonia exposure. The abundance of Bacteroides and Cetobacterium (two kinds of potential probiotics) increased while fish exposed to 10 mg L−1 ammonia. The Flavobacterium (a potential fish pathogen) showed increasing trends when the exposure dose reached 50 mg L−1, while the Bacteroides and Cetobacterium showed almost no abundance. The results also revealed that ammonia exposure concentration or time can alter the intestinal microbial community. In conclusion, ammonia exposure could induce the immune response in crucian carp, and alter the gut microbial community.

Whereas many melanoma patients exhibit profound response to ICT, there are fewer options for patients failing ICT—particularly with BRAF-wild-type disease. In preclinical studies, specific gut microbiota promotes regression of melanoma in mice. We therefore conducted a study of the effects of pretreatment gut microbiota and metabolites on ICT Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors response in 39 metastatic melanoma patients treated with ipilimumab, nivolumab, ipilimumab plus nivolumab (IN), or pembrolizumab (P). IN yielded 67% responses and 8% stable disease; P achieved 23% responses and 23% stable disease. ICT responders for all types of therapies were enriched for Bacteroides caccae. Among IN responders, the gut microbiome was enriched for Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Bacteroides thetaiotamicron, and Holdemania filiformis. Among P responders, the microbiome was enriched for Dorea formicogenerans. Unbiased shotgun metabolomics revealed high levels of anacardic acid in ICT responders. Based on these pilot studies, both additional confirmatory clinical studies and preclinical testing of these bacterial species and metabolites are warranted to confirm their ICT enhancing activity. © 2017 The Authors",244.0

The results showed that Proteobacteria was the predominant phylum, accounting for 71.31% of all phyla identified in milk from the 2 breeds, and Enterobacter was the predominant genus (24.69%) within the microbial community. Microbial alpha diversity from Saanen goat milk was significantly higher than that of Guanzhong goat milk based on bioinformatic analysis of indices of Chao1, Shannon, Simpson, observed species, and the abundance-based coverage estimator. Functional genes and their likely metabolic pathways were predicted, which demonstrated that the functional genes present in the bacteria in goat milk were enriched in pathways for amino acid metabolism and carbohydrate metabolism, which represented 11.93 and 11.23% of functional genes, respectively. Physicochemical properties such as pH, protein, fat, and AA levels were also determined and correlations made with microbial diversity. We detected a significant difference in the content of lactose and 6 AA, which were higher in Saanen milk than in Guanzhong milk, and positively correlated with microbial carbohydrate metabolism and AA metabolism. Lactococcus, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Enterococcus, and Streptococcus, which are lactose-utilizing genera, were more abundant in Saanen milk than in Guanzhong milk. Higher levels of lactose in Saanen goat milk may explain its greater microbial diversity. We also demonstrated that most of the AA metabolism-related bacterial genera (e.g., Massilia, Bacteroides, Lysobacter) were enriched in Saanen goat milk. In this research, both probiotic and pathogenic bacteria were identified in goat milk, which provided the microbial information necessary to direct the utilization of beneficial microbial resources and prevent the development of harmful organisms in goat milk. © 2017 American Dairy Science Association",40.0

One potential mechanism by which walnuts may exert their health benefit is through modifying the gut microbiome. This study identified the changes in the gut microbial communities that occur following the inclusion of walnuts in the diet. Male Fischer 344 rats (n=20) were randomly assigned to one of two diets for as long as 10 weeks: (1) walnut (W), and (2) replacement (R) in which the fat, fiber, and protein in walnuts were matched with corn oil, protein casein, and a cellulose fiber source. Intestinal samples were collected from the descending colon, the DNA isolated, and the V3-V4 hypervariable region of 16S rRNA gene deep sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq for characterization of the gut microbiota. Body weight and food intake did not differ significantly between the two diet groups. The diet groups had distinct microbial communities with animals consuming walnuts displaying significantly greater species diversity. Walnuts increased the abundance of Firmicutes and reduced the abundance of Bacteriodetes. Walnuts enriched the microbiota for probiotic-type bacteria including Lactobacillus, Ruminococcaceae, and Roseburia while significantly reducing Bacteroides and Anaerotruncus.

We investigated the changes on cecal microbiota and short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) associated with body weight loss in overweight mice. Firstly, mice were fed with standard (ST5) or high-fat (HF5) diet for five weeks. Secondly, overweight mice were shifted to standard diet alone (HF-ST10) or supplemented with agavins (HF-ST + A10) or oligofructose (HF-ST + O10), for five more weeks. Cecal contents were collected before and after supplementation to determine microbiota and SCFA concentrations. At the end of first phase, HF5 mice showed a significant increase of body weight, which was associated with reduction of cecal microbiota diversity (PD whole tree; non-parametric t test, p < 0.05), increased Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and reduced SCFA concentrations (t test, p < 0.05). After diet shifting, HF-ST10 normalized its microbiota, increased its diversity, and SCFA levels, whereas agavins (HF-ST + A10) or oligofructose (HF-ST + O10) led to partial microbiota restoration, with normalization of the Firmicutes/Bacteroides ratio, as well as higher SCFA levels (p < 0.1).

However, from a microbial ecology perspective, the mechanisms by which alterations to the gut microbiota improve health remain unknown. In this study, we used Illumina MiSeq sequencing to investigate the cecal microbiota of a negative control group (NC), a C. perfringens and Eimeria challenge group with fishmeal supplementation (PC), a group supplemented with fishmeal and infected with coccidia (FC), and group PC with B. licheniformis supplementation (BL). We found that the health status of C. perfringens-challenged chickens was compromised, and that B. licheniformis improved the growth of the chickens challenged with pathogens. Microbial diversity analysis and taxonomic profiling of groups NC, PC, and FC revealed a disturbed cecal microflora of the birds with C. perfringens. We also characterized the microbiota of the chickens in the BL group using several methods. Principal coordinate analysis demonstrated that, compared with group PC, the bacterial community structure of group BL was more similar to that of group NC. Linear discriminant analysis with effect size revealed less differentially represented bacterial taxa between groups BL and NC than between groups PC and NC. In addition, groups BL and NC appeared to have similar overrepresented microbial taxa (such as Bacteroides, Helicobacter, Megamonas, and Akkermansia) compared with group PC. Finally, a phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states analysis indicated that large differences existed between group PC and groups NC and BL. In conclusion, pre-treatment with B. licheniformis reduced the disturbance of the cecal microbiome induced by challenge with C. perfringens and other factors in broiler chickens. © 2017 Lin et al.

"Staudacher H.M., Whelan K.",The low FODMAP diet: Recent advances in understanding its mechanisms and efficacy in IBS,2017,Gut,10.1136/gutjnl-2017-313750,"There is an intensifying interest in the interaction between diet and the functional GI symptoms experienced in IBS. Recent studies have used MRI to demonstrate that short-chain fermentable carbohydrates increase small intestinal water volume and colonic gas production that, in those with visceral hypersensitivity, induces functional GI symptoms. Dietary restriction of short-chain fermentable carbohydrates (the low fermentable oligosaccharide, disaccharide, monosaccharide and polyol (FODMAP) diet) is now increasingly used in the clinical setting. Initial research evaluating the efficacy of the low FODMAP diet was limited by retrospective study design and lack of comparator groups, but more recently well-designed clinical trials have been published. There are currently at least 10 randomised controlled trials or randomised comparative trials showing the low FODMAP diet leads to clinical response in 50%-80% of patients with IBS, in particular with improvements in bloating, flatulence, diarrhoea and global symptoms. However, in conjunction with the beneficial clinical impact, recent studies have also demonstrated that the low FODMAP diet leads to profound changes in the microbiota and metabolome, the duration and clinical relevance of which are as yet unknown. This review aims to present recent advances in the understanding of the mechanisms by which the low FODMAP diet impacts on symptoms in IBS, recent evidence for its efficacy, current findings regarding the consequences of the diet on the microbiome and recommendations for areas for future research. © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2017.

However, some situations such as the use of antibiotics may disrupt the microbiota balance and result in a series of adverse effects. This study aimed to investigate the effects of a commonly used anti-Helicobacter pylori concomitant therapy on the composition of the gut and throat microbiota and any antibiotic resistance that may develop. In addition to the standard regimen, two different supplementary probiotic regimens that both used Saccharomyces boulardii were included. Microbiological culture-based techniques were used to analyse the microbiota composition and antibiotic resistance. Our results showed marked quantitative and qualitative alterations in both the gut and throat microbiota after treatment with not only the standard concomitant therapy but also with either supplementary probiotic regimen. Nevertheless, most of the changes in the gut microbiota (except for yeast and Bacteroides spp. counts) reverted by Day 71, whereas the alterations in the throat microbiota appeared to persist. Patients treated with the eradication therapy in the absence of probiotic supplementation experienced the most pronounced disturbances in the throat microbiota, whereas changes in the throat microbiota appeared to stabilize in the groups that received probiotic supplementation. We also detected higher antibiotic resistance rates for Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcus spp. and Bacteroides spp. after treatment with the eradication therapy. Co-administration of probiotics is likely to be more effective than post-antibiotic supplementation, and although some beneficial effects were observed, the probiotic combination did not exert significant effects on the unbalanced commensal gut and throat microbiota composition. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",19.0

To this end, these microorganisms were grown and incubated either separately, or co-incubated, under anaerobic atmosphere. Afterwards, the microbial cells were recovered and washed, and extracts were prepared using a sterile detergent solution to mimic the intestine detergent content. The extracts prepared from K. marxianus S-2-05 and reference strain K. marxianus MUCL 29917, grown under different conditions, were assessed for their antioxidant properties against superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide. Extracts from both yeasts showed antioxidative effects, which were particularly important for K. marxianus S-02-5 after anaerobic incubation. Moreover, K. marxianus S-02-5 displayed a high level of activity against the aforementioned reactive oxygen species, enhancing that of B. thetaiotaomicron ATCC 29741, after the co-incubation process. Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was used to separate the proteins extracted. Superoxide dismutase, thiol peroxidase, rubrerythrin -intensively produced by B. thetaiotaomicron induced by the yeast-were identified by mass spectrometry. The antioxidative potential evidenced for K. marxianus S-02-5 is another advantage which could justify the utilization of this strain as a probiotic for countering intestinal inflammatory processes. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",5.0

In this study, two different micro-biomass preparation methods were employed to evaluate the diversity of intestinal mucosa-associated microbiota in grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus). Genomic DNAs were isolated either directly from intestinal mucosal samples (group A), or from micro-biomass after microbial dissociation (group B). Community richness, diversity and evenness indices were all higher in group B, but differences were not statistically significant (P = 0.97, P = 0.33, P = 0.34 respectively). Furthermore, group B samples exhibited an increased ratio of bacterial DNA in comparison with group A samples, but the difference was also not statistically significant (P = 0.74). In addition, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups (P > 0.05) at the taxonomic level. Our results support previous findings that there exists a great abundance of the intestinal mucosa-adherent microbiota in the grass carp; among these, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Spirochaetes and Fusobacteria were the most common phyla. Within these microbiota, Paenibacillus, Bacteroides, Bacillus and Cetobacterium genera comprise the majority of the community, implicating their functional importance (e.g. as probiotics) to their host. Our results contribute towards a better understanding of the intestinal microbial profile of grass carp. Both micro-biomass preparation techniques proved to be feasible for studying mucosa-adherent microbiota of grass carp; however, the second method (group B) provides a protocol that is somewhat more effective than the first method (group A). © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",6.0

Methods: Frozen stool samples were available from a previously published clinical study of the synbiotic preparation administered daily for 7 days to full-term Indian infants delivered by C-section. 16S rRNA gene sequencing of fecal bacterial community-DNA was done in 11 infants sampled on day 7 and day 60 of life. Results: All infants showed changes in bacterial diversity with age. While Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were predominant in all, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes were initially low on day 7. In control infants, we observed a significant increase (P = 0.012) in the proportions of Actinobacteria on day 60. In the treated group, during the 60-day period, there was a 10-fold increase in Bacteroidetes, a somewhat smaller increase in Firmicutes, and a reduction in Proteobacteria. Compared to controls, treated infants were increasingly colonized by different Gram-positive genera including Enterococcus, Lactobacillus, and Bifidobacterium. Relatively less known taxa and some unassigned sequence reads added to enriched diversity observed in the treated group. Conclusions: There was a high level of bacterial diversity among infants examined in the present study. Synbiotic treatment induced an increase in overall taxa and Gram-positive diversity, especially in the first week of life. Changes in the microbiota during early infancy should be used as a rationale for selecting probiotics in diverse clinical settings.

Although it was revealed that Berberine (BBR) can decrease fasting plasma glucose (FPG) in T2DM patients, it is rarely absorbed in gastrointestinal tract so that the hypoglycemic mechanism is unclear. Methods: We established mouse models of T2DM and treatment the animals with BBR. Meanwhile, the levels of FPG and fasting insulin (FIns), changes of intestinal microbes, mRNA levels of TLR4, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6, pathological damage and macrophages (MΦs) infiltration in pancreatic islets of mice were measured. Furthermore, THP-1 derived MΦs were used to study the influence of BBR to LPS-TLR4 axis. Results: FPG, FIns, and mRNA levels of TLR4, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6, pathological damage and MΦs infiltration were significantly increased in pancreatic islets of T2DM mice and the probiotics obviously decreased in intestinal tract compared with normal control. However, these parameters were markedly decreased and the probiotics obviously increased in intestinal tract after administration of BBR. Moreover, in THP-1 derived MΦs by BBR treatment, the expression of TLR4, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 were markedly decreased, and the nuclear translocation of NF-κB were blocked. Conclusion: BBR can reduce systemic low-grade inflammation of T2DM mice to alleviate disease, this effect may be through regulating the gut microbes or inhibiting TLR4 signaling pathway. © 2017, E-Century Publishing Corporation.

Ankylosing spondylitis is an inflammatory autoimmune disease and evidence showed that ankylosing spondylitis may be a microbiome-driven disease. Results: To investigate the relationship between the gut microbiome and ankylosing spondylitis, a quantitative metagenomics study based on deep shotgun sequencing was performed, using gut microbial DNA from 211 Chinese individuals. A total of 23,709 genes and 12 metagenomic species were shown to be differentially abundant between ankylosing spondylitis patients and healthy controls. Patients were characterized by a form of gut microbial dysbiosis that is more prominent than previously reported cases with inflammatory bowel disease. Specifically, the ankylosing spondylitis patients demonstrated increases in the abundance of Prevotella melaninogenica, Prevotella copri, and Prevotella sp. C561 and decreases in Bacteroides spp. It is noteworthy that the Bifidobacterium genus, which is commonly used in probiotics, accumulated in the ankylosing spondylitis patients. Diagnostic algorithms were established using a subset of these gut microbial biomarkers. Conclusions: Alterations of the gut microbiome are associated with development of ankylosing spondylitis.

Recent studies have reported the beneficial role of BF in maintaining intestinal homeostasis, stimulating host immunologic development, and preventing infectious colitis caused by pathogenic bacteria. Our previous studies showed that monocolonization of germ-free mice with BF significantly reduced colon inflammations and damage. Methods: In order to investigate the Toll-like receptor-2 (TLR2), TLR4, and interleukin 10 (IL-10) molecular signaling pathways involved in BF-mediated prevention of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. The wild-type (WT), TLR4, TLR2, and IL-10 knockout (-/-) germ-free mice grown were with or without BF colonization for 28 days, and then administered 1% DSS in drinking water for 7 day to induce acute ulcerative colitis. Results: We compared phenotypes such as weight loss, disease activity, intestinal histological scores, and immunohistochemistry for inflammatory cells. Unlike WT and TLR4-/- mice, the severity of DSS-colitis did not improve in TLR2-/- animals after BF colonization. The BF enhanced anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 expression and inhibited pro-inflammatory-related tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) and IL-6 mRNA expression in both WT and TLR4-/-mice. In contrast, the failed to up-regulated IL-10 and down-regulated the TNF-α and IL-6 in BF colonization TLR2-/- mice. In addition, we further perform IL-10-/- mice to clarify whether the BF through TLR2 /IL-10 pathway to alleviate DSS-colitis. There were no significant differences in colitis severity and pro-inflammatory related genes expression in the IL-10-/mice with or without BF colonization. Conclusions: These results indicate the disease-preventing effects of BF in acute DSS-induced colitis may occur through the TLR2/IL-10 signal pathway. © 2017 Chang et al.

This study aims to determine the effects of probiotics (Lactobacillus casei Zhang and Lactobacillus plantarum P-8) administration on milk production, milk functional components, milk composition, and fecal microbiota of dairy cows. Variations in the fecal bacteria microbiota between treatments were assessed based on 16S rRNA profiles determined by PacBio single molecule real-time sequencing technology. The probiotics supplementation significantly increased the milk production and the contents of milk immunoglobulin G (IgG), lactoferrin (LTF), lysozyme (LYS) and lactoperoxidase (LP), while the somatic cell counts (SCC) significantly decreased (P < 0.01). However, no significant difference was found in the milk fat, protein and lactose contents (P > 0.05). Although the probiotics supplementation did not change the fecal bacteria richness and diversity, significantly more rumen fermentative bacteria (Bacteroides, Roseburia, Ruminococcus, Clostridium, Coprococcus and Dorea) and beneficial bacteria (Faecalibacterium prausnitzii) were found in the probiotics treatment group.

As inhibition of intestinal pathogens is an important characteristic of probiotic strains, this study examined whether B. fragilis could inhibit pathogenic bacteria. Results showed that Vibrio parahaemolyticus was inhibited by B. fragilis in vitro, and that B. fragilis could protect both RAW 264.7 and LoVo cells from damage caused by V. parahaemolyticus. Using in vivo imaging, we constructed a light-emitting V. parahaemolyticus strain and showed that B. fragilis might shorten the colonization time and reduce the number of lux-expressing bacteria in a mouse model.

However, studies investigating this impact have mostly included subjects from diverse geographic/socioeconomic backgrounds and hence the precise effects of dietary factors on gut microbiota composition remain largely confounded. Herein, with an aim to evaluate the association between dietary habits, specifically yogurt consumption, and the gut microbiota in healthy young adults sharing similar age, lifestyle routine, geographical setting, etc., we conducted a cross-sectional study wherein 293 collegiate freshmen answered a questionnaire about their frequency of yogurt consumption over the last 2 months and provided stool specimens for microbiota analysis. Fecal microbiota were analyzed by highly sensitive reverse-transcription-quantitative-PCR assays targeting bacterial 16S rRNA molecules. Fecal organic acids were measured by HPLC. Overall, the gut microbiota were predominated (97.1 ± 8.6%) by Clostridium coccoides group, Clostridium leptum subgroup, Bacteroides fragilis group, Bifidobacterium and Atopobium cluster. Interestingly, after adjusting the data for yogurt consumption, females were found to have higher total bacterial (P = 0.013) and Bifidobacterium (P = 0.046) count and fecal pH (P = 0.007) and lower fecal concentration of total organic acids (P = 0.030), succinic acid (P = 0.007) and formic acid (P = 0.046) as compared to males. Altogether, yogurt consumption showed positive linear association with Lactobacillus and Lactobacillus gasseri subgroup in both male and female subjects; however, several gender-specific disparities were also detected in this yogurt-microbiota association. Yogurt consumption demonstrated a negative association with L. sakei subgroup, Enterobacteriaceae and Staphylococcus in males but shared a positive association with L. casei subgroup and succinic acid in female subjects.

This analysis was performed by 454 pyrosequencing using the V3-V6 region of the 16S rRNA genes. Samples collected from 14 healthy, 42 d old Cobb broiler chickens revealed that the dominant bacterial phyla in the seven gastrointestinal sections were Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria. At the genus level, Lactobacillus was predominant in the upper gut (gizzard, proventriculus, duodenum, and jejunum) and ileum, whereas unclassified Lachnospiraceae, unclassified Ruminococcaceae, unclassified Synergistaceae, Bacteroides, and Ruminococcus were predominant in the lower gut (ceca and cloaca).

Faecal microbiota transplantation is a novel form of therapeutic microbial manipulation, but its efficacy in ulcerative colitis is uncertain. We aimed to establish the efficacy of intensive-dosing, multidonor, faecal microbiota transplantation in active ulcerative colitis. Methods We conducted a multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial at three hospitals in Australia. We randomly allocated patients with active ulcerative colitis (Mayo score 4–10) in a 1:1 ratio, using a pre-established randomisation list, to either faecal microbiota transplantation or placebo colonoscopic infusion, followed by enemas 5 days per week for 8 weeks. Patients, treating clinicians, and other study staff were unaware of the assigned treatment. Faecal microbiota transplantation enemas were each derived from between three and seven unrelated donors. The primary outcome was steroid-free clinical remission with endoscopic remission or response (Mayo score ≤2, all subscores ≤1, and ≥1 point reduction in endoscopy subscore) at week 8. Analysis was by modified intention-to-treat and included all patients receiving one study dose. We performed 16S rRNA stool analysis to assess associated microbial changes. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01896635. The trial has ended; this report presents the final analysis. Findings From November, 2013, to May, 2015, 85 patients were enrolled to our trial, of whom 42 were randomly assigned faecal microbiota transplantation and 43 were allocated placebo. One patient assigned faecal microbiota transplantation and three allocated placebo did not receive study treatment and were excluded from the analysis. The primary outcome was achieved in 11 (27%) of 41 patients allocated faecal microbiota transplantation versus three (8%) of 40 who were assigned placebo (risk ratio 3·6, 95% CI 1·1–11·9; p=0·021). Adverse events were reported by 32 (78%) of 41 patients allocated faecal microbiota transplantation and 33 (83%) of 40 who were assigned placebo; most were self-limiting gastrointestinal complaints, with no significant difference in number or type of adverse events between treatment groups. Serious adverse events occurred in two patients assigned faecal microbiota transplantation and in one allocated placebo. Microbial diversity increased with and persisted after faecal microbiota transplantation. Several bacterial taxa were associated with clinical outcome; in particular, the presence of Fusobacterium spp was associated with lack of remission. Interpretation Intensive-dosing, multidonor, faecal microbiota transplantation induces clinical remission and endoscopic improvement in active ulcerative colitis and is associated with distinct microbial changes that relate to outcome. Faecal microbiota transplantation is, thus, a promising new therapeutic option for ulcerative colitis. Future work should focus on precisely defining the optimum treatment intensity and the role of donor–recipient matching based on microbial profiles.

We previously isolated B. fragilis strain ZY-312 and identified it as a novel strain based on 16S rRNA sequencing and morphological analyses. We also determined that ZY-312 displayed desirable probiotic properties, including tolerance to simulated digestive fluid, adherence, and in vitro safety. In this study, we aim to investigate whether ZY-312 meets the safety criteria required for probiotic bacteria through comprehensive and systematic evaluation. Consequently, the fatty acid profile, metabolite production, and biochemical activity of strain ZY-312 were found to closely resemble descriptions of B. fragilis in Bergey's manual. Taxonomic identification of strain ZY-312 based on whole genome sequencing indicated that ZY-312 and ATCC 25285 showed 99.99% similarity. The 33 putative virulence-associated factors identified in ZY-312 mainly encoded structural proteins and proteins with physiological activity, while the lack of bft indicated that ZY-312 was non-toxigenic. In vivo safety was proven in both normal and immune-deficient mice. The 11 identified antibiotic resistance genes were located on the chromosome rather than on a plasmid, ruling out the risk of plasmid-mediated transfer of antibiotic resistance. In vitro, ZY-312 showed resistance to cefepime, kanamycin, and streptomycin. Finally, and notably, ZY-312 exhibited high genetic stability after 100 passages in vitro. This study supplements the foundation work on the safety evaluation of ZY-312, and contributes to the development of the first probiotic representative from the dominant Bacteroidetes phylum. © 2017 Wang, Deng, Li, Tan, Han, Wang, Du, Liu, Yang, Bai, Bi and Zhi.",18.0

As a result, ten percent of premature infants under 1500 grams weight develop an inflammatory necrosis of the intestine after birth, e.g., necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). NEC is a major health problem in this population causing extensive morbidity and mortality and an enormous expenditure of health care dollars. NEC can be prevented by giving preterm infants their mother's expressed breast milk or ingesting selective probiotic organisms. Vaginally delivered, breast fed newborns develop health promoting bacteria (""pioneer"" bacteria) which preferentially stimulate intestinal host defense and anti-inflammation. One such ""pioneer"" organism is Bacteroides fragilis with a polysaccharide (PSA) on its capsule. B. fragilis has been shown developmentally in intestinal lymphocytes and dendritic cells to produce a balanced T-helper cell (TH1/TH2) response and to reduce intestinal inflammation by activity through the TLR2 receptor stimulating IL-10 which inhibits IL-17 causing inflammation. No studies have been done on the role of B. fragilis PSA on fetal enterocytes and its increased inflammation. Accordingly, using human and mouse fetal intestinal models, we have shown that B. fragilis with PSA and PSA alone inhibits IL-1β-induced IL-8 inflammation in fetal and NEC intestine. We have also begun to define the mechanism for this unique inflammation noted in fetal intestine. We have shown that B. fragilis PSA anti-inflammation requires both the TLR2 and TLR4 receptor and is in part mediated by the AP1 transcription factor (TLR2) which is developmentally regulated. These observations may help to devise future preventative treatments of premature infants against NEC. © 2017 Jiang et al.

ERA has a strong association with human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 and subclinical gut inflammation. In an HLA-B27 transgenic rat model, the presence of Bacteroides bacteria in the gut appears to cause spondyloarthropathy (SpA). Thus, we studied gut microbiota in children with ERA. Stool specimens from 33 patients with ERA and 14 age-matched healthy controls were studied; none had any gastrointestinal symptom, or had received a drug known to affect gut motility or microbiota in the preceding 6 weeks. From each specimen, a cDNA library for the V3 region of bacterial 16S rRNA was subjected to high-throughput, massively parallel sequencing. Relationship of the specimens was studied using principal co-ordinate analysis (PCoA), and abundances of various bacterial taxa and alpha diversity were compared between groups. In eight patients, a repeat faecal specimen was studied after 12 weeks of probiotic therapy. The 55 specimens yielded a median (range) of 397 315 (102 093–1 502 380) high-quality reads each. In PCoA, gut microbiota from ERA showed a wider dispersion than those from controls. In patients, families Bacteroidaceae and Enterobacteriaceae were more abundant and Prevotellaceae were less abundant than in controls. Also, genera Bacteroides, Entercoccus and Klebsiella were over-represented and genus Prevotella was under-represented in ERA patients. Probiotic therapy led to a non-significant increase in Prevotellaceae. Patients with ERA have a dysbiosis in the gut, with increased abundance of Bacteroides and reduction of Prevotella. Probiotic supplementation in a subset of patients did not reverse these changes significantly. © 2016 British Society for Immunology",35.0

Aims To evaluate the ability of Lactobacillus kefiri LKF01 DSM32079 (LKEF) to colonize the intestinal environment of healthy subjects and modify the gut microbiota composition. Methods Twenty Italian healthy volunteers were randomized in pre-prandial and post-prandial groups. Changes in the gut microbiota composition were detected by using a Next Generation Sequencing technology (Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine). Results L. kefiri was recovered in the feces of all volunteers after one month of probiotic administration, while it was detected only in three subjects belonging to the pre-prandial group and in two subjects belonging to the post-prandial group one month after the end of probiotic consumption. After one month of probiotic oral intake we observed a reduction of Bilophila, Butyricicomonas, Flavonifractor, Oscillibacter and Prevotella. Interestingly, after the end of probiotic administration Bacteroides, Barnesiella, Butyricicomonas, Clostridium, Haemophilus, Oscillibacter, Salmonella, Streptococcus, Subdoligranolum, and Veillonella were significantly reduced if compared to baseline samples. Conclusion L. kefiri LKF01 showed a strong ability to modulate the gut microbiota composition, leading to a significant reduction of several bacterial genera directly involved in the onset of pro-inflammatory response and gastrointestinal diseases. © 2016 The Authors",29.0

SIgA binds bacteria using specific antigenic sites or non-specifically via its glycans attached to α-heavy-chain and secretory component. In our study, we tested the hypothesis that human and bovine SIgA have similar innate-binding activity for bacteria. SIgAs, isolated from human and bovine milk, were incubated with a selection of commensal, pathogenic and probiotic bacteria. Using flow cytometry, we measured numbers of bacteria binding SIgA and their level of SIgA binding. The percentage of bacteria bound by human and bovine SIgA varied from 30 to 90% depending on bacterial species and strains, but was remarkably consistent between human and bovine SIgA. The level of SIgA binding per bacterial cell was lower for those bacteria that had a higher percentage of SIgA-bound bacteria, and higher for those bacteria that had lower percentage of SIgA-bound bacteria. Overall, human and bovine SIgA interacted with bacteria in a comparable way. This contributes to longer term research about the potential benefits of bovine SIgA for human consumers. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",11.0

Thus, the gut microbiota constitutes a potential therapeutic target for preventing growth impairment. However, our knowledge in this area is limited. In this study we aimed at evaluating the relationship among early microbiota, growth, and development in preterm infants. To this end we assessed the levels of specific microorganisms by qPCR, and those of short chain fatty acids by mean of gas-chromatography, in feces from 63 preterm newborns and determined their weight-gain during the first months. The statistical analyses performed indicate an influence of the intestinal microbiota in weight-gain, with the levels of some microorganisms showing a significant association with the weight-gain of the infant. The levels of specific microbial groups during the first days of life were found to affect weight gain by the age of 1 month. Moreover, clustering of the infants on the basis of the microbiota composition at 1 month of age rendered groups which showed differences in weight z-scores. Our results suggest an association between the gut microbiota composition and weight-gain in preterm infants at early life and point out potential microbial targets for favoring growth and maturation in these infants. © 2017 Arboleya, Martinez-Camblor, Solís, Suárez, Fernández, de los Reyes-Gavilán and Gueimonde.",20.0

In the gut lumen, RegIIIβ kills not only certain enteropathogens, but also some commensal bacteria; thus, RegIIIβ is also thought to be an innate immune effector shaping microbiota composition and establishing intestinal homeostasis. Using the streptomycin mouse model for Salmonella colitis, we show that RegIIIβ can promote sustained gut colonization of Salmonella Typhimurium and prolong enteropathy. RegIIIβ expression was associated with suppression of Bacteroides spp. in the gut lumen, prolonged disease-associated alterations in colonic metabolism, and reduced luminal vitamin B6 levels. Supplementation with Bacteroides spp. or vitamin B6 accelerated pathogen clearance from the gut and remission of enteropathy. Our findings indicate that interventions at the level of RegIIIβ and supplementation with Bacteroides spp. or vitamin B6 might open new avenues for therapeutic intervention in the context of Salmonella colitis. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",57.0

In this study, microbial shifts resulting from feed supplementation with Bacillus subtilis CSL2 were evaluated in broilers challenged and unchallenged with Salmonella Gallinarum. To analyse bacterial community composition and functionality, 454 GS-FLX pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons was performed. Results: The Quantitative Insights into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) pipeline was used to analyse changes in the faecal microbiota over a 24-h period. A total of 718,204 sequences from broiler chickens were recorded and analysed. At the phylum level, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria were the predominant bacterial taxa. In Salmonella-infected chickens (SC), Bacteroidetes were more highly abundant compared to control (NC) and Bacillus-treated (BT) chickens. At the genus level, in the NC and BT groups, Lactobacillus was present at high abundance, and the abundance of Turicibacter, unclassified Enterobacteriaceae, and Bacteroides increased in SC broilers. Furthermore, taxon-independent analysis showed that the SC and BT groups were compositionally distinct at the end of the 24-h period. Further analysis of functional properties showed that B. subtilis CSL2 administration increased gut-associated energy supply mechanisms (i.e. carbohydrate transport and metabolism) to maintain a stable microbiota and protect gut integrity. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that S. Gallinarum infection and B. subtilis CSL2 supplementation in the diet of broiler chickens influenced the diversity, composition, and functional diversity of the faecal microbiota. Moreover, the findings offer significant insights to understand potential mechanisms of Salmonella infection and the mode of action of probiotics in broiler chickens. © 2016 The Author(s).",38.0

This study aimed to examine the effects of the probiotic Saccharomyces boulardii CNCM I-745 (SB), the antibiotic Amoxicillin-Clavulanate (AC) and the combination on the microbiota and symptoms of healthy humans. Healthy subjects were randomized to one of 4 study groups: SB for 14 days, AC for 7 days, SB plus AC, Control (no treatment). Participants gave stool samples and completed gastro-intestinal symptom questionnaires. Microbiota changes in stool specimens were analyzed using 16s rRNA gene pyrosequencing (bTEFAP). Only one subject withdrew prematurely due to adverse events. Subjects treated by S boulardii + AC had fewer adverse events and tolerated the study regimen better than those receiving the AC alone. Control subjects had a stable microbiota throughout the study period. Significant microbiota changes were noted in the AC alone group during antibiotic treatment. AC associated changes included reduced prevalence of the genus Roseburia and increases in Escherichia, Parabacteroides, and Enterobacter. Microbiota alterations reverted toward baseline, but were not yet completely restored 2 weeks after antibiotherapy. No significant shifts in bacterial genera were noted in the SB alone group. Adding SB to AC led to less pronounced microbiota shifts including less overgrowth of Escherichia and to a reduction in antibiotic-associated diarrhea scores. Antibiotic treatment is associated with marked microbiota changes with both reductions and increases in different genera. S. boulardii treatment can mitigate some antibiotic-induced microbiota changes (dysbiosis) and can also reduce antibiotic-associated diarrhea. © 2017 The Author(s).

To investigate the gut microbiota differences of obese children compared with the control healthy cohort to result in further understanding of the mechanism of obesity development. Methods. We evaluated the 16S rRNA gene, the enterotypes, and quantity of the gut microbiota among obese children and the control cohort and learned the differences of the gut microbiota during the process of weight reduction in obese children. Results. In the present study, we learned that the gut microbiota composition was significantly different between obese children and the healthy cohort. Next we found that functional changes, including the phosphotransferase system, ATP-binding cassette transporters, flagellar assembly, and bacterial chemotaxis were overrepresented, while glycan biosynthesis and metabolism were underrepresented in case samples. Moreover, we learned that the amount of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus increased among the obese children during the process of weight reduction. Conclusion. Our results might enrich the research between gut microbiota and obesity and further provide a clinical basis for therapy for obesity. We recommend that Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus might be used as indicators of healthy conditions among obese children, as well as a kind of prebiotic and probiotic supplement in the diet to be an auxiliary treatment for obesity. © 2017 Ya-Ping Hou et al.",63.0

Objective: To study the effects of a polysaccharide (PPSB) from Physalis alkekengi var. francheti on liver injury and intestinal microflora in type-2 diabetic mice. Materials and methods: Streptozotocin (160 mg/kg) was injected i.p. for 3 days to build model. The diabetic mice were randomly divided into four groups together with control group (10 mice in each group). The doses of PPSB were 50 and 100 mg/kg, respectively. After 5 weeks administration, level of blood glucose, ALT and AST were measured. Alterations of intestinal microflora, and protein expression of TGF-b1, TNF-a and DCN were detected. Results: Level of blood glucose decreased from (25.38 ± 2.21) mmol/L to (18.01 ± 2.53) mmol/L, ALT and AST decreased to (24.67 ± 4.86) U/L and (30.84 ± 7.50) U/L in PPSB-H group.

The frequently outbreak of various diseases has heavily threatened the sustainable development of the scallop industry. The information about the bacterial communities inside and outside the body of Yesso scallop will provide insights into disease prevention, probiotic application and health aquaculture. In the present study, the diversity of bacterial communities in intestines, rectum and gills of Yesso scallop and its habitat waters were investigated. The bacterial diversity and richness in waters were higher than that in intestines, rectum and gills. The microbiota from intestines, rectum, gills of scallop and waters were clearly separated into four clusters by Non-metric multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis, suggesting a microbiota selection of scallop at organ scale. Venn diagram suggested that the bacterial community in the body of scallop was more specialized than that in waters. High-throughput sequencing revealed that the main bacterial communities in intestine, rectum and gill were Firmicutes, Tenericute and Proteobacteria, Chlamydiae, Proteobacteria and Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria and Firmicutes, respectively. While the bacterial communities in waters mainly included Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Cyanobacteria. Real-time PCR for bacterial load showed that the total bacterial abundance in waters was significantly higher than that inside the scallop body. The abundance of Bacteroides fragilis in rectum was significantly higher than that in intestines and gills. The results about the bacterial community inside and outside the body of Yesso scallop are helpful to better understand the relationship between the symbiotic bacteria of Yesso scallop and their habitat, and also provided critical information to develop strategies of disease prevention and probiotic application in scallop aquaculture. © 2017, Universita degli Studi di Modena e Reggio Emilia.

To identify the bacteria responsible and the mechanisms involved in the CR, the germ-free (GF) animal model has been used, because in vitro studies cannot always be extrapolated to what occurs in vivo. In this study, ex vivo antagonism assays against seven enteropathogenic bacteria using stools from 15 healthy human donors confirmed that the CR showed individual variation. Using in vitro antagonism assays, 14 strains isolated from dominant faecal microbiota of donors with elevated CR were selected for mono-association in GF mice to test the in vivo antagonism against Salmonella enterica ser.

This effect appeared to be more evident in obese dogs than in lean dogs but was independent of breed. Consumption of either diet increased the bacterial evenness, but not the richness, of the gut compared to that after consumption of the baseline diet. Macronutrient composition affected taxon abundances, mainly within the predominant phyla, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. The LPHC diet appeared to favor the growth of Bacteroides uniformis and Clostridium butyricum, while the HPLC diet increased the abundances of Clostridium hiranonis, Clostridium perfringens, and Ruminococcus gnavus and enriched microbial gene networks associated with weight maintenance. In addition, we observed a decrease in the Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes ratio and an increase in the Bacteroides to Prevotella ratio in the HPLC diet-fed dogs compared to these ratios in dogs fed other diets. Finally, analysis of the effect of diet on the predicted microbial gene network was performed using phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states (PICRUSt). IMPORTANCE More than 50% of dogs are either overweight or obese in the United States. A dysbiotic gut microbiota is associated with obesity and other metabolic problems in humans. HPLC diets have been promoted as an effective weight loss strategy for many years, and potential effects were reported for both humans and dogs. In this study, we explored the influence of the protein and carbohydrate ratio on the gut microbiome in dogs with different body conditions. We demonstrated significant dietary effects on the gut microbiome, with greater changes in obese dogs than in lean dogs. The HPLC diet-fed dogs showed greater abundances of Firmicutes but fewer numbers of Bacteroidetes than other dogs. This knowledge will enable us to use prebiotics, probiotics, and other nutritional interventions to modulate the gut microbiota and to provide an alternative therapy for canine obesity. © 2017 Li et al.",75.0

Low, moderate, or high doses of a Bacillus licheniformis-B. subtilis mixture (BLS mix) were orally administered to piglets of genotype MUC4 that are supposed to be F4-expressing enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli strain (F4+ ETEC) F4ab/ac receptor negative (i.e., MUC4-resistant piglets) for 1 week before F4+ ETEC challenge. The luminal contents were collected from the mucosa of the colon on day 8 after F4+ ETEC challenge. The BLS mix attenuated E. coli-induced expansion of Bacteroides uniformis, Eubacterium eligens, Acetanaerobacterium, and Sporobacter populations. Clostridium and Turicibacter populations increased following F4+ ETEC challenge in pigs pretreated with low-dose BLS mix. Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus salivarius populations increased after administration of BLS mix during E. coli infection. The beneficial effects of BLS mix were due in part to the expansion of certain Clostridium, Lactobacillus, and Turicibacter populations, with a corresponding increase in the number of goblet cells in the ileum via upregulated Atoh1 expression, in turn increasing MUC2 production and thus preserving the mucus barrier and enhancing host defenses against enteropathogenic bacteria. However, excessive BLS mix consumption may increase the risk for enteritis, partly through disruption of colonic microbial ecology, characterized by expansion of Proteobacteria and impaired goblet cell function in the ileum. Our findings suggest that oral administration of BLS mix reprograms the gut microbiota and enhances goblet cell function to ameliorate enteritis. © 2017 American Society for Microbiology.

A life-long gluten free diet (GFD) is the only therapeutic approach. Dysbiosis, which can precede the CD pathogenesis and/or persist when subjects are on GFD, is reviewed and discussed. Salivary microbiota and metabolome differed between healthy and celiac children treated under GFD (T-CD) for at least two years. The type of GFD (African- vs Italian-style) modified the microbiota and metabolome of Saharawi T-CD children. Different studies showed bacterial dysbiosis at duodenal and/or fecal level of patients with active untreated CD (U-CD) and T-CD compared to healthy subjects. The ratio of protective anti-inflammatory bacteria such as Lactobacillus-Bifidobacterium to potentially harmful Bacteroides-Enterobacteriaceae was the lowest in U-CD and T-CD children. In agreement with dysbiosis, serum, fecal and urinary metabolome from U-CD and T-CD patients showed altered levels of free amino acids and volatile organic compounds. However, consensus across studies defining specific bacteria and metabolites in U-CD or T-CD patients is still lacking. Future research efforts are required to determine the relationships between CD and oral and intestinal microbiotas to improve the composition of GFD for restoring the gut dysbiosis as a preventative or therapeutic approach for CD. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",23.0

Lactic acid bacteria are considered the main producers of GABA among bacteria. GABA-producing lactobacilli are isolated from food products such as cheese, yogurt, sourdough, etc. and are the source of bioactive properties assigned to those foods. The ability of human-derived lactobacilli and bifidobacteria to synthesize GABA remains poorly characterized. In this paper, we screened our collection of 135 human-derived Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains for their ability to produce GABA from its precursor monosodium glutamate. Fifty eight strains were able to produce GABA. The most efficient GABA-producers were Bifidobacterium strains (up to 6 g/L). Time profiles of cell growth and GABA production as well as the influence of pyridoxal phosphate on GABA production were studied for L. plantarum 90sk, L. brevis 15f, B. adolescentis 150 and B. angulatum GT102. DNA of these strains was sequenced; the gadB and gadC genes were identified. The presence of these genes was analyzed in 14 metagenomes of healthy individuals. The genes were found in the following genera of bacteria: Bacteroidetes (Bacteroides, Parabacteroides, Alistipes, Odoribacter, Prevotella), Proteobacterium (Esherichia), Firmicutes (Enterococcus), Actinobacteria (Bifidobacterium). These data indicate that gad genes as well as the ability to produce GABA are widely distributed among lactobacilli and bifidobacteria (mainly in L. plantarum, L. brevis, B. adolescentis, B. angulatum, B. dentium) and other gut-derived bacterial species. Perhaps, GABA is involved in the interaction of gut microbiota with the macroorganism and the ability to synthesize GABA may be an important feature in the selection of bacterial strains - psychobiotics. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",142.0

Stimulation of bacteria among different individuals varies greatly, depending on a wide range of variables. Objective To determine the range of differences in response between individuals, a preclinical in vitro fermentation was conducted with six fecal donors. The primary objective was to compare the fecal microbiota of six individuals at baseline, 12 h and 24 h post-exposure to partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG). Method Fecal donations were collected from six healthy individuals consuming a non-specific Western diet, free of antibiotic treatments in the past year, not affected by any GI diseases and not consuming any probiotic or prebiotic supplements. Fecal samples were exposed to 0.5 g of PHGG and measured for bacterial changes at 0, 12 and 24 h based on 16S rRNA sequencing. Results Parabacteroides increased from 3.48% of sequence reads to 10.62% of sequence reads after 24 h (p = 0.0181) and Bacteroidetes increased from 45.89% of sequence reads to 50.29% of sequence reads (p = 0.0008). Conclusions PHGG stimulates growth of Parabacteroides, a genus of bacteria that have been inversely associated with IBS and ulcerative colitis. PHGG provides stimulation of beneficial Bacteroidetes (Bacteroides and Parabacteroides), which may be correlated with many positive health markers and outcomes. PHGG is a prebiotic dietary fiber that is readily fermentable. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",15.0

Flos Chrysanthemi products are usually taken orally and metabolized by intestinal microflora. However, there has been no investigation of the comprehensive metabolic profile of the Flos Chrysanthemi extract by intestinal flora owing to its chemical complexity and the limitations of analytical methods. In this paper, a rapid, sensitive and automated analysis method, ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry including MSE technology and automated data processing Metabolynx™ software, was developed and successfully applied for the biotransformation and metabolic profile of flavonoids in the Flos Chrysanthemi extract by intestinal flora from human and rat. A total of 32 metabolites were detected and tentatively identified in human and rat intestinal bacterial samples. These metabolites indicated that hydrolysis, hydroxylation, acetylation, methylation, hydrogenation and deoxygenation were the major conversion pathways of flavonoids in the Flos Chrysanthemi extract in vitro. Furthermore, the effects of the Flos Chrysanthemi extract on the growth of different intestinal bacteria were detected using an Emax precision microplate reader. Certain pathogenic bacteria such as Enterobacter, Enterococcus, Clostridium and Bacteroides were significantly inhibited by Flos Chrysanthemi, while commensal probiotics such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium were moderately promoted. Our observation provided further evidence for the importance of intestinal bacteria in the metabolism and potential activity of the Flos Chrysanthemi extract. The results will also be helpful for the further pharmacokinetic study of Flos Chrysanthemi and to unravel how it works in vivo. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",10.0

Exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), including bisphenol A (BPA) and ethinyl estradiol (EE), especially during development, may also increase the risk for such disorders. An unexplored possibility is that EDC-exposure might alter the gut microbial composition. Gut flora and their products may thus be mediating factors for the disease-causing effects of these chemicals. To examine the effects of EDCs on the gut microbiome, female and male monogamous and biparental California mice (Peromyscus californicus) were exposed to BPA (50 mg/kg feed weight) or EE (0.1 ppb) or control diet from periconception through weaning. 16s rRNA sequencing was performed on bacterial DNA isolated from fecal samples, and analyses performed for P0 and F1 males and females. Both BPA and EE induced generational and sex-dependent gut microbiome changes. Many of the bacteria, e.g. Bacteroides, Mollicutes, Prevotellaceae, Erysipelotrichaceae, Akkermansia, Methanobrevibacter, Sutterella, whose proportions increase with exposure to BPA or EE in the P0 or F1 generation are associated with different disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), metabolic disorders, and colorectal cancer. However, the proportion of the beneficial bacterium, Bifidobacterium, was also elevated in fecal samples of BPA- and EE-exposed F1 females. Intestinal flora alterations were also linked to changes in various metabolic and other pathways. Thus, BPA and EE exposure may disrupt the normal gut flora, which may in turn result in systemic effects. Probiotic supplementation might be an effective means to mitigate disease-promoting effects of these chemicals. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",86.0

However, only a few diverse bacteria are known to modulate the host immune system via ZPS. We present a genomic screen for bacteria encoding ZPS molecules. We identify diverse host-associated bacteria, including commensals and pathogens with known anti-inflammatory properties, with the capacity to produce ZPSs. Human mononuclear cells stimulated with lysates from putative ZPS-producing bacteria induce significantly greater IL-10 production and higher proportions of Tregs than lysates from non-ZPS-encoding relatives or a commensal strain of Bacteroides cellulosilyticus in which a putative ZPS biosynthetic operon was genetically disrupted. Similarly, wild-type B. cellulosilyticus DSM 14838, but not a close relative lacking a putative ZPS, attenuated experimental colitis in mice.

Scientifically based selection of potential beneficial probiotic strains in functional constipation therapy is not feasible due to insufficient knowledge of microbiota composition in affected subjects. The aim of this study was to describe microbial composition and diversity in children with functional constipation, compared to healthy controls. Study Design: Fecal samples from 76 children diagnosed with functional constipation according to the Rome III criteria (median age 8.0 years; range 4.2-17.8) were analyzed by IS-pro, a PCRbased microbiota profiling method. Outcome was compared with intestinal microbiota profiles of 61 healthy children (median 8.6 years; range 4.1-17.9). Microbiota dissimilarity was depicted by principal coordinate analysis (PCoA), diversity was calculated by Shannon diversity index. To determine the most discriminative species, cross validated logistic ridge regression was performed. Results: Applying total microbiota profiles (all phyla together) or per phylum analysis, no diseasespecific separation was observed by PCoA and by calculation of diversity indices. By ridge regression, however, functional constipation and controls could be discriminated with 82% accuracy. Most discriminative species were Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides ovatus, Bifidobacterium longum, Parabacteroides species (increased in functional constipation) and Alistipes finegoldii (decreased in functional constipation). Conclusions: None of the commonly used unsupervised statistical methods allowed for microbiota-based discrimination of children with functional constipation and controls. By ridge regression, however, both groups could be discriminated with 82% accuracy. Optimization of microbiota- based interventions in constipated children warrants further characterization of microbial signatures linked to clinical subgroups of functional constipation. © 2016 de Meij et al.

We specifically measured Enterococcus, Enterobacter, Bacteroides, and Lactobacillus by plate count and real-time PCR methods, and α-glucosidase, lactate dehydrogenase, esterase, and aminopeptidase activities as indicative of metabolism of sugar, fat, and protein from LAB isolated from feces of mice in vitro. The results showed that administration of Lactobacillus acidophilus LAC0201 and Lactobacillus fermentum LFE0302 lowered the uricacid index of serum. Lactobacillus acidophilus LAC0201, L. fermentum LFE0302, as well as Lactobacillus curvatus LCU0401 administration resulted in a reduction in the opportunistic pathogens (i.e., Enterococcus and Enterobacter), meanwhile, administration of L. fermentum LFE0302 and Lactobacillus sp.

Non-digestible dietary galacto- and gluco-α-(1,6)-oligosaccharides from legumes and starch, respectively, are preferentially fermented by mainly bifidobacteria and lactobacilli in the human gut. Here we show that the solute binding protein (BlG16BP) associated with an ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter from the probiotic Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis Bl-04 binds α-(1,6)-linked glucosides and galactosides of varying size, linkage, and monosaccharide composition with preference for the trisaccharides raffinose and panose. This preference is also reflected in the α-(1,6)-galactoside uptake profile of the bacterium. Structures of BlG16BP in complex with raffinose and panose revealed the basis for the remarkable ligand binding plasticity of BlG16BP, which recognizes the nonreducing α-(1,6)-diglycoside in its ligands. BlG16BP homologues occur predominantly in bifidobacteria and a few Firmicutes but lack in other HGMs. Among seven bifidobacterial taxa, only those possessing this transporter displayed growth on α-(1,6)-glycosides. Competition assays revealed that the dominant HGM commensal Bacteroides ovatus was out-competed by B. animalis subsp. lactis Bl-04 in mixed cultures growing on raffinose, the preferred ligand for the BlG16BP. By comparison, B. ovatus mono-cultures grew very efficiently on this trisaccharide These findings suggest that the ABC-mediated uptake of raffinose provides an important competitive advantage, particularly against dominant Bacteroides that lack glycan-specific ABC-transporters.

Prebiotics and probiotics can modulate microbiome changes induced by aging; however, their effects have not been directly compared. The aim of this study was to use anaerobic batch culture fermenters to assess the impact of various fermentable carbohydrates and microorganisms on the gut microbiota and selected immune markers. Elderly volunteers were used as donors for these experiments to enable relevance to an aging population. The impact of fermentation supernatants on immune markers relevant to the elderly were assessed in vitro. Levels of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and TNF-α in peripheral blood mononuclear cell culture supernatants were measured using flow cytometry. Trans-galactooligosaccharides (B-GOS) and inulin both stimulated bifidobacteria compared to other treatments (p<0.05). Fermentation supernatants taken from faecal batch cultures supplemented with B-GOS, inulin, B. bifidum, L. acidophilus and Ba. coagulans inhibited LPS induced TNF-α (p<0.05). IL-10 production, induced by LPS, was enhanced by fermentation supernatants from faecal batch cultures supplemented with B-GOS, inulin, B. bifidum, L. acidophilus, Ba. coagulans and Bac. thetaiotaomicron (p<0.05).

As a model of this interaction, we sought to determine whether colonization of the murine host with symbiotic non-toxigenic Bacteroides fragilis could limit acquisition of pathogenic enterotoxigenic B. fragilis. We observed strain-specific competition with toxigenic B. fragilis, dependent upon type VI secretion, identifying an effector–immunity pair that confers pathogen exclusion. Resistance against host acquisition of a second non-toxigenic strain was also uncovered, revealing a broader function of type VI secretion systems in determining microbiota composition. The competitive exclusion of enterotoxigenic B. fragilis by a non-toxigenic strain limited toxin exposure and protected the host against intestinal inflammatory disease. Our studies demonstrate a novel role of type VI secretion systems in colonization resistance against a pathogen.

Among the 113 children with no antibiotics before weaning, each month of breastfeeding decreased the mean number of postweaning antibiotic courses by 5%(95%CI, 2% to 8%; P = .001) and mean BMI z scores by 0.08 unit (95%CI, 0.04 to 0.11; P < .001). Among the 113 early-life antibiotic users, the effect of breastfeeding on postweaning antibiotic use was borderline significant (estimated 4%decrease per month; 95%CI, 0% to 7%; P = .04) and the effect on BMI z score disappeared (estimated 1% increase; 95%CI, -3% to 5%; P = .50). In the subcohort of 42 children with fecal microbiota composition analysis, the children with short breastfeeding duration (0-6 months) and no early-life antibiotic use or with long breastfeeding duration (8-16 months) and early-life use of antibiotics had a significantly lower abundance of Bifidobacterium (by 55%; 95%CI, 43% to 87%; P = .006; and 39%, 95%CI, 30% to 68%; P < .001, respectively) and Akkermansia (by 71%; 95%CI, 28% to 87%; P = .008; and 69%; 95%CI, 22% to 90%; P = .02, respectively) compared with those with long duration of breastfeeding and no early-life antibiotics. Conclusions and relevance: Antibiotic use in a child during breastfeeding may weaken the beneficial effects of long breastfeeding duration. The results suggest that particularly the long-term metabolic benefits of breastfeeding are conveyed by the intestinal microbiota. © 2016 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.",51.0

However, the effect of their combination with probiotics on gut ecology and bone metabolism has not yet been studied. We investigated whether the combination of a probiotic with a defined microbial strain results in improved bone mineralization, and whether this effect is associated with changes in gut ecology. Methods: Eighty ovariectomized adult rats were allocated to five groups: group 1, sham-operated (SHAM); group 2-5, ovariectomized (OVX). Semipurified diets containing 0.7% calcium and 0.5% phosphorus were fed for 16 weeks, group 1 and group 2 got no supplements, group 3 (PRO) was supplemented with a potential probiotic (Lactobacillus acidophilus NCC90), group 4 (PRE) with prebiotics (oligofructose + acacia gum) and group 5 (SYN) with synbiotics (probiotics + prebiotics). Results: Ovariectomy increased body weight and reduced bone weight, content of calcium, phosphorus and ash of bone, bone alkaline phosphatase (BAP), and bone structure. This was indicated by lower trabecular bone area, trabecular perimeter, and connectivity but higher epiphyseal breadth. Ovariectomy elevated the jejunal pH. The probiotic alone did not significantly affect bone mineralization and gut ecology. Rats on prebiotics had significantly higher amounts of cecal contents and lower pH in cecal and colonic contents. Their calcium balance tended to be increased (p < 0.1). Synbiotics reduced pH in different intestinal segments, significantly in cecum. They stimulated most the colonic absorption surface as indicated by colon weight. Only feeding synbiotics significantly prevented OVX-induced loss of calcium content in lumbar vertebrae (mg) with final values (mean ± SD) of 44.44 ± 2.94 (SHAM), 41.20 ± 4.59 (OVX), 41.63 ± 3.78 (PRO), 43.42 ± 3.07 (PRE), and 44.68 ± 2.28 (SYN). This effect was associated with higher counts of bifidobacteria in the short-term and Bacteroides in the long-term, and with a tendency for lower BAP with 128.7 ± 28.5 U/L vs. 155.3 ± 28.1 U/L in OVX (p < 0.1). Conclusion: SYN exerted a synergistic effect on bone mineralization, presumably due to changes in gut microbiota and ecology associated with large bowel digesta weight (most likely reflecting microbial mass) and with large bowel weight (reflecting absorptive area), while bone turnover tended to be reduced as indicated by BAP. © 2016 The Authors.",56.0

Consequently, it has been proposed as a potential novel probiotic because of its therapeutic effects on immune imbalance, mental disorders and inflammatory diseases. Macrophages play a central role in the immune response, developing either a classical-M1 or an alternative-M2 phenotype after stimulation with various signals. The interactions between macrophages and B. fragilis, however, remain to be defined. Here, a new isolate of B. fragilis, ZY-312, was shown to possess admirable properties, including tolerance to simulated gastric fluid, intestinal fluid and ox bile, and good safety (MOI = 100, 200) and adherent ability (MOI = 100) to LoVo cells. Isolate ZY-312 cell lysate promoted phagocytosis of fluorescent microspheres and pathogenic bacteria in bone marrow-derived macrophage (BMDM) cells. Gene expression of IL-12, iNOS and IL-1β in BMDM cells was increased after treatment with ZY-312, indicating the induction of M1 macrophages, consistent with enhanced secretion of NO. Cell surface expression of CD80 and CD86 was also increased. This study is the first to demonstrate that B. fragilis enhances the phagocytic functions of macrophages, polarising them to an M1 phenotype. Our findings provide insight into the close relationship between B. fragilis and the innate immune system.",40.0

METHODS: In a randomized, controlled, non-blinded prospective clinical trial 82 patients with intestinal-borne facial dermatoses characterized by an erythematous papular-pustular rash were screened. At the initiation visit 37 patients entered the experimental arm and 20 patients constituted the control arm. All 57 patients were treated with a vegetarian diet and conventional topical therapy of the dermatoses with ointments containing tetracycline, steroids and retinoids. In the experimental arm patients received a one month therapy with oral E. coli Nissle at a maintenance dose of 2 capsules daily. The experimental group was compared to a non-treatment group only receiving the diet and topical therapy. The primary outcome parameter was improvement of the dermatoses, secondary parameters included life quality and adverse events. In addition the immunological reaction profile (IgA, interleucin-8 and interferon-a) was determined. Furthermore the changes of stool consistency and the microbiota composition over the time of intervention were recorded. RESULTS: Eighty-nine percent of the patients with acne, papular-pustular rosacea and seborrhoic dermatitis responded to E. coli Nissle therapy with significant amelioration or complete recovery in contrast to 56% in the control arm (P &lt; 0.01). Accordingly, in the E. coli Nissle treated patients life quality improved significantly (P &lt; 0.01), and adverse events were not recorded. The clinical improvement was associated with a significant increase of IgA levels to normal values in serum as well as suppression of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-8 (P &lt; 0.01 for both parameters). In the E. coli Nissle treated group a shift towards a protective microbiota with predominance of bifidobacteria and lactobacteria (&gt; 107 CFU/g stool) was observed in 79% and 63% of the patients, respectively (P &lt; 0.01), compared to no change in the control group without E. coli Nissle. Moreover, the detection rate of a pathogenic flora dropped from 73% to 14 % of the patients in the experimental arm (P &lt; 0.01) with no significant change in the control arm (accounting 80% before and 70% after the observation period, P &gt; 0.05). Accordingly, stool consistency, color and smell normalized in the E. coli Nissle treated patients. CONCLUSION: E. coli Nissle protects the mucus barrier by overgrowth of a favorable gut microbiota with less immunoreactive potential which finally leads to clinical improvement of intestinal borne dermatoses. © 2016 Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

Here, we report that maternal high-fat diet (MHFD) induces a shift in microbial ecology that negatively impacts offspring social behavior. Social deficits and gut microbiota dysbiosis in MHFD offspring are prevented by co-housing with offspring of mothers on a regular diet (MRD) and transferable to germ-free mice. In addition, social interaction induces synaptic potentiation (LTP) in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of MRD, but not MHFD offspring. Moreover, MHFD offspring had fewer oxytocin immunoreactive neurons in the hypothalamus. Using metagenomics and precision microbiota reconstitution, we identified a single commensal strain that corrects oxytocin levels, LTP, and social deficits in MHFD offspring. Our findings causally link maternal diet, gut microbial imbalance, VTA plasticity, and behavior and suggest that probiotic treatment may relieve specific behavioral abnormalities associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",536.0

Understanding the link between these behavioral changes and IBD is important clinically since concomitant mood disorders often increase a patient’s risk of requiring surgery and developing secondary functional gastrointestinal diseases. Anxiety-like behavior (light/dark box test) and recognition memory (novel object recognition task) were determined at the peak and during resolution of inflammation in the dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) mouse model of acute colitis. DSS (5 days) was administered via drinking water followed by 3 or 9 days of normal drinking water to assess behavior during active or resolving inflammation, respectively. Disease (weight, colon length, and histology) was assessed and the composition of the gut microbiota was characterized by using qPCR on fecal pellet DNA. In a subset of mice, pretreatment with probiotics was started 1 wk prior to commencing DSS. During active inflammation (8 days), mice demonstrated impaired recognition memory and exhibited anxiety-like behavior vs. controls. These behavioral defects were normalized by 14 days post- DSS. Shifts in the composition of the gut microbiota were evident during active inflammation, notably as decreases in lactobacilli and segmented filamentous bacteria, which were also reversed once the disease had resolved. Administration of probiotics could prevent the behavioral defects seen in acute DSS. Taken together, our findings indicate that changes in mood and behavior are present during acute inflammation in murine IBD and associated with dysbiosis and that these outcomes can be prevented by the administration of probiotics. © 2016 the American Physiological Society.",73.0

Compositional analysis showed that these fractions were rich in glucose, arabinose, and galacturonic acid. The prebiotic potentials of these fractions were evaluated via single culture with Bifidobacterium infantis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Clostridium perfringens, and Bacteroides fragilis. Results showed that POS2 had higher prebiotic property than POS1 and 3, and it was comparable to fructooligosaccharide. In mixed culture, POS2 showed positive effect on B. infantis, while negative effect on B. fragilis according to the results of real-time quantitative PCR analysis.

Although the etiology and pathogenesis of IBD are still largely unknown, dysregulated host/enteric microbial interactions are requisite for the development of IBD. So far, many researchers have tried to identify a precise relationship between IBD and an imbalance of the intestinal microbiota, termed ""dysbiosis."" Despite extensive efforts, it is still largely unknown about the interplay among microbes, their hosts, and their environments, and whether dysbiosis is a causal factor or an effect of IBD. Recently, deep-sequencing analyses of the microbiota in patients with IBD patients have been instrumental in characterizing the strong association between dysbiosis and IBD development, although it is still unable to identify specific-associated species level changes in most cases. Based on many recent reports, dysbiosis of the commensal microbiota is implicated in the pathogenesis of several diseases, including IBD, obesity, and allergic disorders, in both human and animal models. In this review article, the authors have focused on explaining the multiple types of dysbiosis, as well as dysbiosis-related diseases and potential treatments to apply this knowledge to understand a possible cause and potentially find therapeutic strategies for IBD as well as the other dysbiosis-related diseases. © 2016 Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America, Inc.",263.0

However, the core microbial communities in the wild bar-headed geese remain totally unknown. Here, for the first time, we present a comprehensive survey of bar-headed geese gut microbial communities by Illumina high-throughput sequencing technology using nine individuals from three distinct wintering locations in Tibet. A total of 236,676 sequences were analyzed, and 607 OTUs were identified. We show that the gut microbial communities of bar-headed geese have representatives of 14 phyla and are dominated by Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes. The additive abundance of these four most dominant phyla was above 96% across all the samples. At the genus level, the sequences represented 150 genera. A set of 19 genera were present in all samples and considered as core gut microbiome. The top seven most abundant core genera were distributed in that four dominant phyla. Among them, four genera (Lactococcus, Bacillus, Solibacillus, and Streptococcus) belonged to Firmicutes, while for other three phyla, each containing one genus, such as Proteobacteria (genus Pseudomonas), Actinobacteria (genus Arthrobacter), and Bacteroidetes (genus Bacteroides). This broad survey represents the most in-depth assessment, to date, of the gut microbes that associated with bar-headed geese.

The study population comprised 5 healthy cows and 5 cows with endometritis. The results indicated that the vaginal bacterial microflora of healthy postpartum cows was dominated by Lactobacillus sakei subsp. and Weissella koreensis, while there were no dominant bacterial species in the vaginal microflora of postpartum cows with endometritis. Common microorganisms such as Bacteroides spp., Fusobacterium spp., Enterococcus spp., Prevotella spp., Clostridium perfringens strains, and Escherichia coli were detected in both groups of cows by Real-time PCR. The bacterial diversity in the vagina of cows with endometritis was significantly higher than that in healthy cows. The results indicated that the vaginal microflora of cows with endometritis was more diverse and lacked dominant bacterial species as compared to that of the healthy cows, suggesting that disruption of the normal vaginal microflora may contribute to the onset of endometritis.

In this method, probiotic cultures of bacteria present in the colonic region were prepared and added to the dissolution media and compared with the performance of conventional dissolution methodologies (such as media with rat cecal and human fecal media). In this study, the predominant species (such as Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus species, Eubacterium and Streptococcus) were cultured in 12% w/v skimmed milk powder and 5% w/v grade “A” honey. Approximately 1010-1011 colony forming units m/L of probiotic culture was added to the dissolution media to test the drug release of polysaccharide-based formulations. A USP dissolution apparatus I/II using a gradient pH dissolution method was used to evaluate drug release from formulations meant for colonic drug delivery. Drug release of guar gum/Eudragit FS30D coated 5-fluorouracil granules was assessed under gastric and small intestine conditions within a simulated colonic environment involving fermentation testing with the probiotic culture. The results with the probiotic system were comparable to those obtained from the rat cecal and human fecal-based fermentation model, thereby suggesting that a probiotic dissolution method can be successfully applied for drug release testing of any polysaccharide-based oral formulation meant for colonic delivery. As such, this study significantly adds to the nanostructured biomaterials’ community by elucidating an easier assay for colonic drug delivery. © 2016 Kotla et al.",22.0

Methods: Male Wistar rats were orally administrated with or without L. casei Zhang for 30 days prior to challenge with LPS and GalN. Dexamethasone administrated group serving as a positive anti-inflammation control. Serum, intestinal and liver samples were collected 8 h after LPS/GalN challenge for histological, molecular and biochemical analysis. Results: LPS/GalN challenge alone resulted in significantly increased production of endotoxin, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) and nitric oxide as compared to the normal control rats. Pretreatment with L. casei Zhang not only reduced these changes, but also attenuated hepatic inflammation as shown by improved histological assessment, decreased myeloperoxidase activity and reduced expression of IL-1β and inducible nitric oxide synthase in the liver. L. casei Zhang supplementation significantly inhibited LPS/GalN-triggered phosphorylation of ERK, JNK and p-38 MAPK, but increased the expression of TLR2, TLR9 and PPAR-γ. Moreover, L. casei Zhang treatment prevented intestinal injury and modulated the intestinal ecology by increasing the fecal Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium levels.

In this work, we analyzed these interactions in mice that were mono-associated with six microorganisms that are representative of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-associated dysbiosis: the bacteria Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, adhesive-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC), Ruminococcus gnavus and Roseburia intestinalis; a yeast used as a probiotic drug, Saccharomyces boulardii CNCM I-745; and another yeast, Candida albicans. Extensive ex vivo analyses including colon transcriptomics, histology, immune response, bile acid metabolism and short-chain fatty acid production were studied. We showed that B. thetaiotaomicron had the highest impact on the immune system because it was almost able to recapitulate the effects of the entire conventional microbiota and notably induced Treg pathways. Furthermore, these analyses uncovered the effects of E. coli AIEC LF82 on indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase expression and of S. boulardii CNCM I-745 on angiogenesis. These results were confirmed in vitro in human cell lines. Finally, our results suggested that R. gnavus has major effects on metabolism, and notably on tryptophan metabolism.

Peptidoglycan recognition proteins (Pglyrps) are antibacterial, participate in maintaining intestinal microflora, and modulate inflammatory responses. Mice deficient in any one of the four Pglyrp genes are more sensitive to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis, and stools from Pglyrp-deficient mice transferred to wild type (WT) germ-free mice predispose them to much more severe colitis than stools from WT mice. However, the identities of these Pglyrp-regulated bacteria that predispose Pglyrp-deficient mice to colitis or protect WT mice from colitis are not known. Here we identified significant changes in β-diversity of stool bacteria in Pglyrp-deficient mice compared with WT mice. The most consistent changes in microbiome in all Pglyrp-deficient mice were in Bacteroidales, from which we selected four species, two with increased abundance (Prevotella falsenii and Parabacteroides distasonis) and two with decreased abundance (Bacteroides eggerthii and Alistipes finegoldii). We then gavaged WT mice with stock type strains of these species to test the hypothesis that they predispose to or protect from DSS-induced colitis. P. falsenii, P. distasonis, and B. eggerthii all enhanced DSS-induced colitis in both WT mice with otherwise undisturbed intestinal microflora and in WT mice with antibiotic-depleted intestinal microflora. By contrast, A. finegoldii (which is the most abundant species inWT mice) attenuated DSS-induced colitis both in WT mice with otherwise undisturbed intestinal microflora and in WT mice with antibiotic-depleted intestinal microflora, similar to the colitis protective effect of the entire normal microflora.

"Gallego C.G., Salminen S.",Novel probiotics and prebiotics: How can they help in human gut microbiota dysbiosis?,2016,Applied Food Biotechnology,10.22037/afb.v3i2.11276,"Background and Objectives: Novel probiotics and prebiotics designed to modulate the gut microbiota for improving health outcomes are in demand as the importance of the gut microbiota in human health is revealed. A review of the scientific literature regarding the current knowledge and novel species and novel oligosaccharides for the treatment of dysbiosis-associated diseases has been carried out due to their growing interest. Results and Conclusions: The regulations governing introduction of novel probiotics and prebiotics vary by geographical region. Novel foods and foods with health claims fall under specific regulations in several countries. In European Union (EU), safety is assessed by novel food approval process and by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) established Quantitative Presumption of Safety (QPS) system for bacteria and other biologicals. Any messages on health benefits are covered by the European Regulation on Health Claims (ERHC), also assessed by EFSA. Examples of recent novel probiotics in EU include Clostridium butyricum, and Bacteroides xylanisolvens and examples of novel prebiotics include human milk oligosaccharides such as Lacto-N-neotetraose. Yacon root is an example on a previously novel prebiotic food which is allowed due to the reported existing cultivation and use in EU prior to the novel food regulation. Potential future candidates include further human milk oligosaccharides and bacteria such Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Akkermasia muciniphila. Increasing knowledge on human intestinal microbiota and microbiota development enables the design of new more specific and hitherto unknown probiotics and prebiotics. Also understanding the microbe and microbe host interactions facilitates the search for novel probiotics and prebiotics.",31.0

The effects of strains of Propionibacterium acidipropionici isolated from poultry intestine on microbiota activity and intestinal mucosa development were investigated in the early stage of rearing chicks and the safety of the dose used was investigated. The strains P. acidipropionici LET105 and LET107, administered as monoculture to chicks from the 1st to 14th day of life in a daily dose of 106 cfu/ml administered in the drinking water resulted harmless. The animals arrived at the expected weight for age and no differences were observed with respect to the food intake and water consumption related to control without bacteria administration. The analysis of microbiota composition revealed the presence of propionibacteria at the middle and end of the trial only in treated groups. Normal development of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria, and slow colonisation by Bacteroides at the 7th day of the study was observed in the same groups. Analysis of the organic acids concentrations in the caecal content of birds revealed higher lactic acid and lower butyric acid production. Lower short chain fatty acids total concentration than expected during treatment was related to a better development of the gut mucosa. Increase in length of villus-crypt units, goblet cells counts and neutral mucins production were evidenced. Higher mucus secretion produced by dietary supplementation with propionibacteria could provide increased protection against pathogens. © 2016 Wageningen Academic Publishers.",14.0

The PubMed database was searched from January 2000 to May 2015 for studies and review articles on the composition, pathophysiologic effects and therapeutic modulation of the IM in cirrhosis. The following combination of relevant text words and MeSH terms were used, namely intestinal microbiome, microbiota, or dysbiosis, and cirrhosis, encephalopathy, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hepatorenal syndrome, variceal bleeding, hepatopulmonary syndrome, portopulmonary hypertension and hepatocellular carcinoma. The search results were evaluated for pertinence to the subject of IM and cirrhosis, as well as for quality of study design. The IM in cirrhosis is characterized by a decreased proportion of Bacteroides and Lactobacilli, and an increased proportion of Enterobacteriaceae compared to healthy controls. Except for alcoholic cirrhosis, the composition of the IM in cirrhosis is not affected by the etiology of the liver disease. The percentage of Enterobacteriaceae increases with worsening liver disease severity and decompensation and is associated with bacteremia, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatic encephalopathy. Lactulose, rifaximin and Lactobacillus-containing probiotics have been shown to partially reverse the cirrhosis associated enteric dysbiosis, in conjunction with improvement in encephalopathy. The IM is altered in cirrhosis, and this may contribute to the development of complications associated with end-stage liver disease. Therapies such as lactulose, rifaximin and probiotics may, at least partially, reverse the cirrhosisassociated changes in the IM. This, in turn, may prevent or alleviate the severity of complications. © The Author(s) 2016.",11.0

Emerging evidences have shown a close interplay between obesity, diabetes, and intestinal flora disturbance. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, exemplified by sitagliptin, is highly efficacious in treating type 2 diabetes (T2DM), yet little is known if sitagliptin exerts beneficial effects on microbiota associated with obesity and T2DM. We evaluated changes of gut microbiota following the induction of obesity and T2DM in a streptozotocin treated high fat/high carbohydrate fed (HF/HC-STZ) rat model and explored the effect of sitagliptin on gut microbiota for HF/HC-STZ rats. Methods. Sitagliptin was administered via oral gavage to diabetic rats. Fecal DNA extraction and 454 pyrosequencing based on analysis of 16S rRNA genes was utilized to determine the overall structure of microbiota in fecal DNA samples. Results. Results showed that, at the level of phylum, there was higher abundance of Firmicutes and Tenericutes and less abundance of Bacteroidetes in obese rats compared to their lean counterparts. At the level of genus, short-chain fatty acid- (SCFA-) producing bacteria, Blautia, Roseburia, and Clostridium, and probiotics Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and so forth were identified significantly different from each other among conditions. Conclusion. Marked shifts of the gut microbiota structure were observed in the rats during development of glucose intolerance. Intestinal flora changed in the process of glucose intolerance, and treatment of sitagliptin moderately corrected the dysbiosis of microbiota in T2DM. © 2016 Xinfeng Yan et al.",59.0

Inversely, the effects of the microbiota on iron homeostasis have been little studied. So, we investigate whether the microbiota itself may alter host iron sensing. Duodenal cytochrome b and divalent metal transporter 1, involved in apical iron uptake, are 8- and 10-fold, respectively, more abundant in the duodenum of germ-free (GF) mice than in mice colonized with a microbiota. In contrast, the luminal exporter ferroportin is 2-fold less abundant in GF. The overall signature of microbiota on iron-related proteins is similar in the colon. The colonization does not modify systemic parameters as plasma transferrin saturation (20%), plasma ferritin (150 ng/L), and liver (85 μg/g) iron load. Commensal organisms (Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron VPI-5482 and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii A2-165) and a probiotic strain (Streptococcus thermophilus LMD-9) led to up to 12-fold induction of ferritin in colon. Our data suggest that the intestinal cells of GF mice are depleted of iron and that following colonization, the epithelial cells favor iron storage. This study is the first to demonstrate that gut microbes induce a specific iron-related protein signature, highlighting new aspects of the crosstalk between the microbiota and the intestinal epithelium. © FASEB.",50.0

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of heat-killed Lactobacillus kunkeei YB38 (YB38) at a dose of approximately 10 mg/day on human intestinal environment and bowel movement. This single-blind study enrolled 29 female subjects with a low defecation frequency who consumed heat-killed YB38 at four increasing dosage levels: 0 (placebo), 2, 10, and 50 mg. Each dose was consumed daily for two weeks, with a two-week baseline period preceding the dosing-period and a two-week washout period ending the study. Observed levels of Bacteroides fragilis group significantly decreased with intake of heat-killed YB38 at ≥10 mg/day compared with levels during placebo intake (P<0.01). Faecal pH significantly decreased with 10 and 50 mg/day intake (P<0.01 and 0.05, respectively). Acetic acid levels tended to increase in faeces at the 50 mg/day dose (P<0.1). Bowel movement tended to increase in all heat-killed YB38 intake periods (P<0.1). In conclusion, heat-killed YB38 altered human intestinal microbiota at doses of ≥10 mg/day and tended to increase bowel movement at ≥2 mg/day.

This study sought to clarify the relationship of dysbiosis with allergies in adults. Methods: Publicly available American Gut Project questionnaire and fecal 16S rRNA sequence data were analyzed. Fecal microbiota richness (number of observed species) and composition (UniFrac) were used to compare adults with versus without allergy to foods (peanuts, tree nuts, shellfish, other) and non-foods (drug, bee sting, dander, asthma, seasonal, eczema). Logistic and Poisson regression models adjusted for potential confounders. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for lowest vs highest richness tertile. Taxonomy associations considered 122 non-redundant taxa (of 2379 total taxa) with ≥. 0.1% mean abundance. Results: Self-reported allergy prevalence among the 1879 participants (mean age, 45.5 years; 46.9% male) was 81.5%, ranging from 2.5% for peanuts to 40.5% for seasonal. Fecal microbiota richness was markedly lower with total allergies (P = 10-9) and five particular allergies (P ≤ 10-4). Richness odds ratios were 1.7 (CI 1.3-2.2) with seasonal, 1.8 (CI 1.3-2.5) with drug, and 7.8 (CI 2.3-26.5) with peanut allergy. These allergic participants also had markedly altered microbial community composition (unweighted UniFrac, P = 10-4 to 10-7). Total food and non-food allergies were significantly associated with 7 and 9 altered taxa, respectively. The dysbiosis was most marked with nut and seasonal allergies, driven by higher Bacteroidales and reduced Clostridiales taxa. Interpretation: American adults with allergies, especially to nuts and seasonal pollen, have low diversity, reduced Clostridiales, and increased Bacteroidales in their gut microbiota. This dysbiosis might be targeted to improve treatment or prevention of allergy. © 2015 .",111.0

The strain showed pre-clinical efficacy in a mouse obesity model. The objective of this study was to evaluate its potential toxicity and translocation ability after acute oral administration to mice. Methods and Findings A safety study was conducted in immunocompetent and immunosuppressed C57BL-6 mice. Both mouse groups (n = 10 per group) were fed orally 2 x 109 colony forming units (cfu)/day of B. uniformis CECT 7771 or placebo by gavage for 6 days. Throughout this time, feed and water intake and body weight were monitored. Afterwards, mice were sacrificed and biological samples were collected to analyze blood and urine biochemistry, inflammatory and immune markers; gut mucosal histology and bacterial translocation to peripheral tissues. The results demonstrated that acute ingestion of this Bacteroides strain had no adverse effects on the animals' general health status or food intake, nor did it affect biochemical indicators of liver, kidney and pancreatic function or gut mucosal histology. Findings also demonstrated that administration did not lead to bacterial translocation to blood, liver or mesenteric lymph nodes. B. uniformis CECT 7771 also downregulated gene and protein expression (iNOS and PPAR-ã) and inflammatory cytokines induced by immunosuppression. Conclusions The findings indicate that the acute oral consumption of B. uniformis CECT 7771 does not raise safety concerns in mice.

Interestingly, a series of studies have shown the effects of physical exercise on gut microbiota dynamics, suggesting that gut microbiota regulation might act as one mediator for the effects of exercise on the brain. Recent studies found that gut microbiota dynamics are also regulated by metabolism changes, such as through physical exercise or diet change. Interestingly, physical exercise modulates different population of gut bacteria in compared to food restriction or rich diet, and alleviates gut syndromes to toxin intake. Gut microbiota could as well contribute to the beneficial effects of exercise on cognition and emotion, either directly through serotonin signaling or indirectly by modulating metabolism and exercise performance. © 2015 Bentham Science Publishers.",9.0

Objective Our goal was to assess the adaptive immune response to the intestinal microbiota present in 143 healthy adults and compare this response with the response observed in 52 children and their mothers at risk of having allergic disease. Methods Human serum was collected from adults and children followed from birth to 7 years of age, and the serum IgG response to a panel of intestinal microbiota antigens was assessed by using a novel protein microarray. Results Nearly every subject tested, regardless of health status, had serum IgG that recognized a common set of antigens. Seroreactivity to the panel of antigens was significantly lower in atopic adults. Healthy infants expressed the highest level of IgG seroreactivity to intestinal microbiota antigens. This adaptive response developed between 6 and 12 months of age and peaked around 2 years of age. Low IgG responses to certain clusters of microbiota antigens during infancy were associated with allergy development during childhood. Conclusions There is an observed perturbation of the adaptive response to antigens from the microbiota in allergic subjects. These perturbations are observable even in childhood, suggesting that optimal stimulation of the adaptive immune system by the microbiota might be needed to prevent certain immune-mediated diseases. © 2015 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology",30.0
Rosenfeld C.S.,Special section on drug metabolism and the microbiome - Perspective microbiome disturbances and autism spectrum disorders,2015,Drug Metabolism and Disposition,10.1124/dmd.115.063826,"Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are considered a heterogenous set of neurobehavioral diseases, with the rates of diagnosis dramatically increasing in the past few decades. As genetics alone does not explain the underlying cause in many cases, attention has turned to environmental factors as potential etiological agents. Gastrointestinal disorders are a common comorbidity in ASD patients. It was thus hypothesized that a gut-brain link may account for some autistic cases. With the characterization of the human microbiome, this concept has been expanded to include the microbiota-gut-brain axis. There are mounting reports in animal models and human epidemi-ologic studies linking disruptive alterations in the gut microbiota or dysbiosis and ASD symptomology. In this review, we will explore the current evidence that gut dysbiosis in animal models and ASD patients correlates with disease risk and severity. The studies to date have surveyed how gut microbiome changes may affect these neurobehavioral disorders. However, we harbor other microbiomes in the body that might impact brain function. We will consider microbial colonies residing in the oral cavity, vagina, and the most recently discovered one in the placenta. Based on the premise that gut microbiota alterations may be causative agents in ASD, several therapeutic options have been tested, such as diet modulations, prebiotics, probiotics, synbiotics, postbiotics, antibiotics, fecal transplantation, and activated charcoal. The potential benefits of these therapies will be considered. Finally, the possible mechanisms by which changes in the gut bacterial communities may result in ASD and related neurobehavioral disorders will be examined.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this effect remain unclear. Using gnotobiotic mice harboring 15 strains of predominant human gut-derived microbiota (HGM), we investigated the effects of Bifidobacterium longum BB536 (BB536-HGM) supplementation on the gut luminal metabolism. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics showed significantly increased fecal levels of pimelate, a precursor of biotin, and butyrate in the BB536-HGM group. In addition, the bioassay revealed significantly elevated fecal levels of biotin in the BB536-HGM group. Metatranscriptomic analysis of fecal microbiota followed by an in vitro bioassay indicated that the elevated biotin level was due to an alteration in metabolism related to biotin synthesis by Bacteroides caccae in this mouse model. Furthermore, the proportion of Eubacterium rectale, a butyrate producer, was significantly higher in the BB536-HGM group than in the group without B. longum BB536 supplementation.

Methods and Results: AD-like skin lesions in BALB/C mice were induced by sensitization and subsequent repeated challenges with trimellitic anhydride (TMA) for 10 days. LCR35 was orally administered to the mice once daily throughout the study. In the TMA-induced AD model, orally administered LCR35 suppressed significantly irritant-related scratching behaviour and skin dehydration as well as apparent severity of AD. LCR35 also significantly decreased serum levels of IgE and IL-4, but not IFN-γ, implying the restoration of TMA-induced disruption of Th1/Th2 balance. Quantitative real-time PCR targeting hypervariable regions of 16S rDNA gene of faecal microbiota indicated that the LCR35 treatment increased the population of Bifidobacterium, Lactobacilli, Enterococcus and Bacteroides fragilis group, but decreased those of Clostridium coccoides group.

The present study evaluated changes in the microbial community and in virulence gene expression in E. coli O157:H7 in ligated pig intestine in which the bacteria formed AE lesions or failed to form AE lesions. Methodology/Principal Findings: The intestinalmicrobiota was assessed by RNA-based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis. The DGGE banding patterns showed distinct differences involving two bands which had increased intensity specifically in AE-negative pigs (AE- bands) and several bands which were more abundant in AE-positive pigs. Sequence analysis revealed that the two AE- bands belonged to Veillonella caviae, a species with probiotic properties, and Bacteroides sp. Concurrent with the differences inmicrobiota, gene expression analysis by quantitative PCR showed that, compared with AE negative pigs, E. coliO157:H7 in AE positive pigs had upregulated genes for putative adhesins, non-LEE encoded nleA and quorum sensing qseF, acid resistance gene ureD, and genes fromthe locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE). Conclusions/Significance: The present study demonstrated that AE-positive pigs had reduced activities or populations of Veillonella caviae and Bacterioides sp. compared with AE-negative pigs.

While IBD in adults has shown to be associated with marked changes in the intestinal microbiota, there are only a few studies in children, and particularly studies focusing on therapeutic responses are lacking. Hence, this prospective study addressed the intestinal microbiota in pediatric IBD especially related to the level of inflammation.METHODS:In total, 68 pediatric patients with IBD and 26 controls provided stool and blood samples in a tertiary care hospital and 32 received anti-tumor necrosis factor-α (anti-TNF-α). Blood inflammatory markers and fecal calprotectin levels were determined. The intestinal microbiota was characterized by phylogenetic microarray and qPCR analysis.RESULTS:The microbiota varied along a gradient of increasing intestinal inflammation (indicated by calprotectin levels), which was associated with reduced microbial richness, abundance of butyrate producers, and relative abundance of Gram-positive bacteria (especially Clostridium clusters IV and XIVa). A significant association between microbiota composition and inflammation was indicated by a set of bacterial groups predicting the calprotectin levels (area under curve (AUC) of 0.85). During the induction of anti-TNF-α, the microbial diversity and similarity to the microbiota of controls increased in the responder group by week 6, but not in the non-responders (P<0.01; response related to calprotectin levels). The abundance of six groups of bacteria including those related to Eubacterium rectale and Bifidobacterium spp. predicted the response to anti-TNF-α medication.CONCLUSIONS:Intestinal microbiota represents a potential biomarker for correlating the level of inflammation and therapeutic responses to be further validated. © 2015 by the American College of Gastroenterology.",133.0

The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of Lactobacillus salivarius Ren (Ren) in modulating colonic microbiota structure and colon cancer incidence in a rat model after injection with 1,2-dimethyl hydrazine (DMH). The results indicated that oral administration of Ren could effectively suppress DMH-induced colonic carcinogenesis. A significant decrease in cancer incidence (87.5% to 25%) was detected in rats fed with a dose of 5 × 1010 CFU/kg bodyweight per day. Using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and Real-time PCR combined with multivariate statistical methods, we demonstrated that injection with DMH significantly altered the rat gut microbiota, while Ren counteracted these DMH-induced adverse effects and promoted reversion of the gut microbiota close to the healthy state. Tvalue biplots followed by band sequencing identified 21 bacterial strains as critical variables affected by DMH and Ren. Injection of DMH significantly increased the amount of Ruminococcus species (sp.) and Clostridiales bacteria, as well as decreasing the Prevotella sp. Administration of Ren reduced the amount of Ruminococcus sp., Clostridiales bacteria, and Bacteroides dorei, and increased the amount of Prevotella. Real-time PCR results were consistent with the results derived by t-value biplots. These findings suggested that Ren is a potential agent for colon cancer prevention.

Bacteroides was the most abundant genus in the groups that received L. rhamnosus CNCM I-4036 or L. paracasei CNCM I-4034. The Shannon indices were significantly increased in these two groups. Our results also revealed a significant increase in the Lactobacillus genus after the intervention with L. rhamnosus CNCM I-4036. The initially different colon microbiota became homogeneous in the subjects who received L. rhamnosus CNCM I-4036. While some ordersthat were initially present disappeared after the administration of L. rhamnosus CNCM I-4036, other orders, such as Sphingobacteriales, Nitrospirales, Desulfobacterales, Thiotrichales, and Synergistetes, were detected after the intervention. In summary, our results show that the intake of these three bacterial strains induced changes in the colon microbiota. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",38.0

However, rodent models are limited by several important physiological and metabolic differences from humans, and many rodent models do not dependably replicate the clinical manifestations of human diseases. Due to the high degree of similarity in anatomy, physiology, immunology and brain growth, the domestic pig (Sus scrofa) is considered a clinically relevant model to study factors influencing human gastrointestinal, immune, and brain development. Gnotobiotic piglet models have been developed and shown to recapitulate key aspects of GN rodent models. Human microbiota-associated (HMA) piglets have been established using inocula frominfants, children, and adults. The gut microbiota of recipientHMApigletswas more similar to that of the human donor than that of conventionally reared piglets harboring a pig microbiota. Moreover, Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides, two predominant bacterial groups of infant gut,were successfully established in theHMApiglets. Thus, theHMApig model has the potential to be a valuable model for investigating how the gut microbiota composition changes in response to environmental factors, such as age, diet, vaccination, antibiotic use and infection. The HMA also represents a robust model for screening the efficacy of pre- and probiotic interventions. Lastly, HMA piglets can be an ideal model with which to elucidate microbe-host interactions in human health and disease due to the similarities to humans in anatomy, physiology, developmental maturity at birth, and the pathophysiology of many human diseases. © The Author 2015.",69.0

The aim of this study was to further investigate the effects of probiotic yogurt consumption on gut microbiota in patients with this disease.METHODS: A total of 305 participants were divided into three groups; group A (IBD patients receiving probiotic yogurt; n=105), group B (IBD patients receiving placebo; n=105), and control group (healthy individuals receiving probiotic yogurt; n=95). Stool samples were collected both before and after 8 weeks of intervention; and population of Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides in the stool specimens was measured by Taqman real-time PCR method.RESULTS: By the end of the intervention, no significant variations in the mean weight and body mass index were observed between three groups (p>0.05). However, the mean numbers of Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Bacteroides in group A were significantly increased compared to group B (p<0.001, p<0.001, and p< 0.01, respectively). There were also significant differences in the mean numbers of either of three bacteria between group A and the healthy control group; however, these differences between two groups were observed both at baseline and the end of the intervention.CONCLUSIONS: Consumption of probiotic yogurt by patients with IBD may help to improve intestinal function by increasing the number of probiotic bacteria in the intestine and colon.

Day-old Cobb broilers (n ≤ 448) were allocated in four treatments for 6 weeks. Each treatment had four replicates (two per gender) of 28 broilers each. Depending on the type of addition per kg basal diet, treatments were C (no other addition), PL (108 colony forming units of probiotic), PH (109 colony forming units of probiotic) and A (2.5 mg avilamycin). Overall bodyweight gain was better (P ≤ 0.002) in PL and PH than in the control (2082 g) by 8.7% and 7.5%, respectively, while treatment PL did not differ from A (2341 g), which showed the highest bodyweight gain. The ileal and total-tract apparent digestibility of DM and the apparent metabolisable energy content corrected for N improved linearly (P ≤ 0.05) with the probiotic level. Fluorescent in situ hybridisation analysis showed caecal Bifidobacterium levels to increase linearly (P ≤ 0.006) with the probiotic level. Probiotic administration resulted in altered caecal VFA patterns compared with the control. Gender effects (P ≤ 0.05) were noted for caecal levels of C. histolyticum group, Bacteroides fragilis group and Streptococcus spp., while interactions (P ≤ 0.05) of treatment with gender were seen for Bifidobacterium and all VFA components, except for acetate. In conclusion, beneficial effects on bodyweight gain, DM digestibility, apparent metabolisable energy content corrected for N, caecal Bifidobacterium levels and VFA patterns were noted with both probiotic inclusion levels. © 2015 CSIRO.",12.0

However, it is not known whether alteration of the gut microbiota from changes in diet in turn changes the colonization of Salmonella. The current study describes an investigation of the effects of medium composition on chicken cecal microbiota and subsequent colonization of Salmonella in vitro. Both batch fermentation and chemostat systems were used to compare the effects on bacterial community by different culture media, which were either rich in starch and peptone (Veal Infusion medium, VI) or rich in simple sugars and hydrolyzed peptide (Viande-Levure medium, VL). Polymerase Chain Reaction-Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) and quantitive real-time PCR (qPCR) were used to ascertain that the growth of chicken cecal microbiota in VL medium resulted in a Bacteroides-enriched community that was closer to the initial cecal inoculum. However, VI medium produced a microbiota represented mainly by Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. A time-dependent reduction of Salmonella was observed only in VI microbiota and the decrease was correlated with a marked increase in the proportion of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium relative to other species. Supernatant from lactic-acid bacteria (LAB) isolates from VI microbiota showed lactic acid-independent bacteriocidal activity on Salmonella. Animal challenge experiment also showed that LAB isolates have the function of decrease S. pullorum colonization in vivo. In summary, our results suggest that in vitro enriched microbiota with probiotic compositions can reduce colonization by Salmonella. © 2015, Life Science Journal. All rights reserved.",
"Shoaib A., Dachang W., Xin Y.",Determining the role of a probiotic in the restoration of intestinal microbial balance by molecular and cultural techniques,2015,Genetics and Molecular Research,10.4238/2015.February.20.8,"The human intestine has a vast variety of microorganisms, and their balance is dependent on several factors. Antibiotics affect microfloral balance and allow naturally opportunistic organisms to multiply. Azithromycin is the most widely used macrolide antibiotic, active against a wide number of pathogens including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. It is currently used in the treatment of cystic fibrosis patients. The use of probiotics has advantages in gastrointestinal conditions, including infectious diarrhea and imbalance due to antibiotic use. In this research, the effect of azithromycin on the intestinal microbiota of Sprague Dawley rats and the role of Lactobacillus acidophilus in the restoration of the balance by employing molecular and cultural techniques was investigated. PCR with universal primers targeting the V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene followed by DGGE was used to characterize the overall intestinal microbiota composition. Cultivable fecal bacteria count using microbiological media and semi-quantitative PCR with group- specific primers were also utilized to analyze the effects of antibiotic and probiotic on microflora. We found that the total amount of 16S rRNA gene and fecal aerobic bacterial count was reduced following azithromycin administration along with elimination of non-pathogenic Escherichia coli, but it was restored by the use of the probiotic. The results from PCR with group-specific primers showed that Bacteroides sp was present in the control and probiotic groups, but it was nearly eliminated in the antibiotic group. Moreover, semi-quantitative PCR revealed that the numbers of Enterobacteriaceae were nearly the same in the probiotic group and decreased in the antibiotic group, while Bifidobacterium was significantly increased in the probiotic group and decreased in the antibiotic group (P < 0.05) as compared with that in the control group. Azithromycin-induced dysbiosis can result in prolonged deleterious effects on the host. The present study revealed that the use of lactic acid bacteria particularly L. acidophilus helped to restore intestinal microfloral balance. © FUNPEC-RP.",10.0

Both prepared dextrins met the definition criterion of dietary fiber and also the basic prebiotic criterion - they were not degraded by the digestive enzymes of the initial sections of the gastrointestinal tract. The growth of probiotic lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, as well as Escherichia coli, Enterococcus, Bacteroides, and Clostridium strains isolated from feces of healthy people, showed that both studied dextrins were utilized as a source of assimilable carbon and energy by the strains. Furthermore, better growth (higher numbers of cells) counts of probiotic bacteria than those of fecal isolates indicated that the studied resistant dextrins showed a selective effect. Both dextrins might be considered as substances with prebiotic properties due to their chemical and physical properties and selectivity towards the studied probiotic bacterial strains.",7.0

Digested Zesy002 kiwifruit was added to in vitro pH-controlled anaerobic batch fermenters that were inoculated with representative human faecal microbiota. Alterations to the gut microbial ecology were determined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metabolic end products were measured using gas chromatography and liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry. Results indicated a substantial shift in the composition of bacteria within the gut models caused by kiwifruit supplementation. Zesy002 supplemented microbiota had a significantly higher abundance of Bacteroides spp., Parabacteroides spp. and Bifidobacterium spp. after 48 h of fermentation compared with the start of the fermentation. Organic acids from kiwifruit were able to endure simulated gastrointestinal digestion and were detectable in the first 10 h of fermentation. The fermentable carbohydrates were converted to beneficial organic acids with a particular predilection for propionate production, corresponding with the rise in Bacteroides spp. and Parabacteroides spp. These results support the claim that Zesy002 kiwifruit non-digestible fractions can effect favourable changes to the human colonic microbial community and primary metabolites, and demonstrate a hitherto unknown effect of Zesy002 on colonic microbiota under in vitro conditions. © 2015 Wageningen Academic Publishers.",9.0

To investigate how probiotics alter the physiological and psychological changes induced by antibiotics, we tested the performance of ampicillin-treated rats in the presence or absence of Lactobacillus fermentum strain NS9, in elevated plus maze and Morris water maze. The results showed that NS9 normalised the composition of gut microbiota and alleviated the ampicillin-induced inflammation in the colon. The levels of the mineralocorticoid and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors were also elevated in the hippocampus of the ampillicin+NS9 treated group. NS9 administration also reduced the anxiety-like behaviour and alleviated the ampicillin-induced impairment in memory retention.

In this addendum, we summarize the findings of our recent study on the fecal microbiota and metabolomes of children with pervasive developmental disorder–not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) or autism (AD) compared with healthy children (HC). Children with PDD-NOS or AD have altered fecal microbiota and metabolomes (including neurotransmitter molecules). We hypothesize that the degree of microbial alteration correlates with the severity of the disease since fecal microbiota and metabolomes alterations were higher in children with PDD-NOS and, especially, AD compared to HC. Our study indicates that the levels of free amino acids (FAA) and volatile organic compounds (VOC) differ in AD subjects compared to children with PDD-NOS, who are more similar to HC.

This microbial community gradually increases in number and diversity until the age of two or three years when it becomes a stable ecosystem resembling that of adults. This period constitutes a unique window of opportunity to modulate it through probiotic action, with a potential impact in later health. In the present work we have investigated how putative bifidobacterial probiotics modify the metabolic profiles and immune-modulatory properties of faecal microbiotas. An in vitro pH-controlled single-stage continuous-culture system (CCS) inoculated with infant faeces was employed to characterise the effects of two Bifidobacterium species on the intestinal microbiotas in three children, together with the effects of these modified microbiotas on cytokine production by HT-29 cells. Intestinal bacterial communities, production of short-chain fatty acids and lactate were determined by quantitative PCR and gas chromatography, respectively. Cytokines production by HT-29 cells was measured by ELISA. The combination of CCS with infant faeces and human intestinal cells provided a suitable model to evaluate the specific modulation of the intestinal microbiota and immune system by probiotics. In the CCS, infant faecal microbiotas were influenced by the addition of bifidobacteria, resulting in changes in their ability to induce the production of immune mediators by HT-29 cells. The different metabolic and immunological responses induced by the bifidobacterial species tested indicate the need to assess potential probiotics in model systems including complex intestinal microbiotas. Potential probiotic bifidobacteria can modulate the infant microbiota and its ability to induce the production of mediators of the immune response by intestinal cells. © 2015 Wageningen Academic Publishers.",13.0

The current study is a follow-up work of a previous clinical trial, and it aimed at understanding the mechanism of the observed desirable effects by evaluating the change in faecal bacterial structure at phylogenetic level. The genomic DNAs used for 16S rRNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-pyrosequencing were obtained from the previous clinical trial. Briefly, 33 recruited subjects were given a single daily oral dose of Lp-8 (6×10 10 cfu) for 4 weeks. Faecal genomic DNAs were extracted from samples collected before (day 0) and after (day 28) Lp-8 consumption from the subjects. Our results show that the consumption of Lp-8 did not result in major change in the faecal bacterial structure by principal coordinate analysis. However, multivariate analysis of variance and analysis of UniFrac metric distances at day 0 and day 28 revealed significant difference in the faecal bacterial structure upon Lp-8 treatment. Thus, the difference lied on the less abundant rather than the predominant lineages. At genus level, the relative abundance of 5 Firmicutes genera (Leuconostoc, Lactobacillus, Sporacetigenium, Blautia and Staphylococcus) significantly increased after Lp-8 consumption, whereas 3 Proteobacteria genera (Shigella, Escherichia and Enterobacter) decreased (P &lt; 0.05). 60 key responding lineages could be identified at operational taxonomic unit (OTU) level by redundancy analysis. Among them, the abundance of 18 OTUs showed significant difference (P &lt; 0.05), while 12 OTUs exhibited modest change (0.05 &lt; P &lt; 0.01) upon treatment.

To investigate the effect of the gut microbiota on host lipid metabolism, a hyperlipidemic rat model was established by feeding rats a high-fat diet for 28 days, and the gut microbiota of the rats was analyzed using real-time PCR before and after administration of Lactobacillus rhamnosus hsryfm 1301 and its fermented milk for 28 days. The findings showed that the Lactobacillus spp., Bifidobacterium spp., Bacteroides spp., and Enterococcus spp. content in the hyperlipidemic rats gut was increased significantly (p < 0.05), while the Clostridium leptum and Enterobacter spp. content was decreased significantly after intervening with L. rhamnosus hrsyfm 1301 and its fermented milk for 28 days (p < 0.05).

Previous studies have indicated that probiotics transiently reside in the gastrointestinal tract and, in addition to modulating commensal species diversity, increase the expression of genes for carbohydrate metabolism in resident commensal bacterial species. In this study, it is demonstrated that the human gut commensal species Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron efficiently metabolizes fructan exopolysaccharide (EPS) synthesized by probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri strain 121 while only partially degrading reuteran and isomalto/malto-polysaccharide (IMMP) α-glucan EPS polymers. B. thetaiotaomicron metabolized these EPS molecules via the activation of enzymes and transport systems encoded by dedicated polysaccharide utilization loci specific for β-fructans and α-glucans. Reduced metabolism of reuteran and IMMP α-glucan EPS molecules may be due to reduced substrate binding by components of the starch utilization system (sus). This study reveals that microbial EPS substrates activate genes for carbohydrate metabolism in B. thetaiotaomicron and suggests that microbially derived carbohydrates provide a carbohydrate-rich reservoir for B. thetaiotaomicron nutrient acquisition in the gastrointestinal tract. © 2015, American Society for Microbiology.",33.0

A 2-week antibiotics treatment induced a colonic dysbiosis (increments in Bacteroides spp, Clostridium coccoides andLactobacillus spp and reduction in Bifidobacterium spp). Bacterial adherence was not affected. Dysbiosis was associated with increased levels of secretory-IgA, up-regulation of the antimicrobial lectin RegIIIγ, and toll-like receptors (TLR) 4 and 7 and down-regulation of the antimicrobial-peptide Resistin-Like Molecule-β and TLR5. Dysbiotic mice showed less goblet cells, without changes in the thickness of the mucus layer. Neither macroscopical nor microscopical signs of inflammation were observed. In dysbiotic mice, expression of the cannabinoid receptor 2 was up-regulated, while the cannabinoid 1 and the mu-opioid receptors were down-regulated. In antibiotic-treated mice, visceral pain-related responses elicited by intraperitoneal acetic acid or intracolonic capsaicin were significantly attenuated. Colonic contractility was enhanced during dysbiosis. Intestinal dysbiosis induce changes in the innate intestinal immune system and modulate the expression of pain-related sensory systems, an effect associated with a reduction in visceral pain-related responses. Commensal microbiota modulates gut neuro-immune sensory systems, leading to functional changes, at least as it relates to viscerosensitivity.

As a significant proportion of UC patients treated with conventional therapies do not achieve remission, there is a pressing need for the development of more effective therapies. The human gut contains a large, diverse, and dynamic population of microorganisms, collectively referred to as the enteric microbiota. There is a symbiotic relationship between the human host and the enteric microbiota, which provides nutrition, protection against pathogenic organisms, and promotes immune homeostasis. An imbalance of the normal enteric microbiota composition (termed dysbiosis) underlies the pathogenesis of UC. A reduction of enteric microbiota diversity has been observed in UC patients, mainly affecting the butyrateproducing bacteria, such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii , which can repress pro-inflammatory cytokines. Many studies have shown that enteric microbiota plays an important role in anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory activities, which can benefit UC patients. Therefore, manipulation of the dysbiosis is an attractive approach for UC therapy. Various therapies targeting a restoration of the enteric microbiota have shown efficacy in treating patients with active and chronic forms of UC. Such therapies include fecal microbiota transplantation, probiotics, prebiotics, antibiotics, helminth therapy, and dietary polyphenols, all of which can alter the abundance and composition of the enteric microbiota. Although there have been many large, randomized controlled clinical trials assessing these treatments, the effectiveness and safety of these bacteria-driven therapies need further evaluation. This review focuses on the important role that the enteric microbiota plays in maintaining intestinal homeostasis and discusses new therapeutic strategies targeting the enteric microbiota for UC. © 2014 Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

The genes expressed by these microorganisms constitute the gut microbiome and may participate in diverse functions that are essential to the host, including digestion, regulation of energy metabolism, and modulation of inflammation and immunity. The gut microbiome can be modulated by dietary changes, antibiotic use, or disease. Different ailments have distinct associated microbiomes in which certain species or genes are present in different relative quantities. Thus, identifying specific disease-associated signatures in the microbiome as well as the factors that alter microbial populations and gene expression will lead to the development of new products such as prebiotics, probiotics, antimicrobials, live biotherapeutic products, or more traditional drugs to treat these disorders. Gained knowledge on the microbiome may result in molecular lab tests that may serve as personalized tools to guide the use of the aforementioned products and monitor interventional progress. © 2014 Landes Bioscience.",31.0

Recent methodological advances have spurred the recognition of microbiomes as complex communities with important influences on the health and disease status of the host.

Review and meta-analysis of public data showed cecal communities dominated by Firmicutes and Bacteroides at the phylum level, while at finer levels of taxonomic resolution, a phylogenetically diverse assemblage of microorganisms appears to have similar metabolic functions that provide important benefits to the host as inferred from metagenomic data. This observation of functional redundancy may have important implications for management of the microbiome. We foresee advances in strategies to improve gut health in commercial operations through management of the intestinal microbiota as an alternative to in-feed subtherapeutic antibiotics, improvements in pre- and probiotics, improved management of polymicrobial poultry diseases, and better control of human pathogens via colonization reduction or competitive exclusion strategies.

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of probiotic Lactobacillus casei CRL 431 administration on intestinal and humoral immune response, clinical parameters, and gut microbiota was evaluated using a high-fat diet to induce obesity in a mouse model. Methods: Adult mice received a conventional balanced diet or a high-fat diet supplemented with milk, milk fermented by Lactobacillus casei (FM), L. casei as suspension, or water over 60d. Histology of liver and small intestine (SI), immunoglobulin A-positive cells and macrophages in SI, phagocytic activity of spleen and peritoneal macrophages, and humoral immune response to ovalbumin were studied. Clinical parameters in serum and gut microbiota were also analyzed. Results: FM was the most effective supplement for decreasing body weight and clinical parameters in serum. The histology of liver and SI was also improved in obese mice given FM. These animals had increased numbers of immunoglobulin A-positive cells and macrophages in SI. The gut microbiota showed that obese mice given probiotics had increased Bacteroides and bifidobacteria. Administration of FM or L. casei as suspension enhanced the phagocytic activity of macrophages. The anti-ovalbumin specific immune response was not increased by any supplement assayed. Conclusion: Administration of probiotics to obese hosts improved the gut microbiota and the mucosal immunity altered by obesity, down-regulated some biochemical parameters in blood associated with metabolic syndrome, and decreased liver steatosis. These results demonstrate the potential use of probiotics in obese individuals to decrease the body weight and to improve the biochemical and immunologic parameters altered by obesity. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",34.0

METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study with a two species probiotic combination [Lactobacillus acidophilus (L. acidophilus ) ATCC 700396 and Bifidobacterium lactis (B. lactis ) ATCC SD5220] on healthy adults during and after antibiotic treatment (amoxicillin 875 and 125 mg clavulanate). The dominant faecal microbiota was studied by real time-polymerase chain reaction to determine if this probiotic preparation could facilitate restoring the microbiota to its pre-antibiotic state and influence the prevalence of beta-lactam resistance. Gastrointestinal symptoms were recorded by questionnaire and Bristol stool scale. RESULTS: Subjects on the probiotic combination had significantly higher faecal counts of L. acidophilus ATCC 700396 and B. lactis at day 8 (end of antibiotic treatment period) vs those on placebo. Furthermore, subjects on the probiotic combination had significantly higher faecal counts of L. acidophilus ATCC 700396 and B. lactis at Day 15 (end of probiotic treatment) vs those on placebo. Lactobacillus counts remained stable in the probiotic group over the course of the study, while Clostridium XIV group was higher at the end of the study and closer to baseline levels; this in contrast to the placebo group. Beta-lactam resistance in creased after antibiotic exposure and was not different between both treatment groups. Gastrointestinal symptoms were generally mild and did not differ between the treatment groups, which correlates with the generally small changes in the microbiota. CONCLUSION: Consumption of the probiotic combination mainly leads to an increase in the faecal levels of the species included in the preparation. © 2014 Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

However, there has been little work performed to assess any such benefit in health or disease. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of probiotics on faecal levels of four important candidate gastrointestinal bacteria (Bacteroides species, Enterococcus faecium, Fibrobacter succinogenes and Clostridium spiroforme) in pet rabbits. Additional aims were to evaluate the effect of probiotics on bodyweight and faecal weight and diameter.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Double-blind triple cross-over study in six healthy rabbits orally administered two probiotic strains, Saccharomyces cerevisiae NCYC Sc47 and E. faecium NCIMB 30183. Levels of bacteria in faecal pellets were subsequently determined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction.RESULTS: Oral administration of probiotic E. faecium NCIMB 30183 was associated with a significant (P = 0 · 042) increase in faecal levels of E. faecium. However, probiotic treatment did not affect faecal levels of Bacteroides species, F. succinogenes or C. spiroforme, bodyweight, or faecal weight and diameter.CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The inclusion of dietary probiotic supplementation using E. faecium NCIMB 30183 can increase faecal levels of certain bacterial flora of healthy adult rabbits.

The Bacillus subtilis WL001 endoglucanase gene (celW) and Aspergillus fumigatus WL002 phytase gene (phyW) mature peptide (phyWM) were cloned into an expression vector with the lactate dehydrogenase promoter of Lactobacillus casei and the secretion signal peptide of the Lactococcus lactis usp45 gene. This construct was then transformed into Lactobacillus reuteri XC1 that had been isolated from the gastrointestinal tract of broilers. Heterologous enzyme production and feed effectiveness of this genetically modified L. reuteri strain were investigated and evaluated. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis showed that the molecular mass of phyWM and celW was approximately 48.2 and 55 kDa, respectively, consistent with their predicted molecular weights. Endoglucanase and phytase activities in the extracellular fraction of the transformed L. reuteri culture were 0.68 and 0.42 U/mL, respectively.

Such observations have been combined with an increasing evidence base that has culminated in the concept of the brain-gut axis. Nevertheless, it has not been until recently that the gut and its attendant components have been considered to influence higher cerebral function and behaviour per se. Moreover, the proposal that the gut and the bacteria contained therein (collectively referred to as the microbiota) can modulate mood and behaviours, has an increasing body of supporting evidence, albeit largely derived from animal studies. The gut microbiota is a dynamic and diverse ecosystem and forms a symbiotic relationship with the host. Herein we describe the components of the gut microbiota and mechanisms by which it can influence neural development, complex behaviours and nociception. Furthermore, we propose the novel concept of a 'state of gut' rather than a state of mind, particularly in relation to functional bowel disorders. Finally, we address the exciting possibility that the gut microbiota may offer a novel area of therapeutic intervention across a diverse array of both affective and gastrointestinal disorders. © 2014 The Physiological Society.",39.0

However, the route and metabolites of calycosin-7-O-β-d-glucoside by human intestinal bacteria are not well understood and its metabolites may accumulate to exert physiological effects. Therefore, the objective of this study was to screen the ability of the bacteria to metabolize calycosin-7-O-β-d-glucoside and assess the effect of this compound on the intestinal bacteria. Finally, five strains including Bacteroides sp.13, and sp.58, Clostridium sp.21-2, Veillonella sp.43-1, and Bacillus sp.46 were isolated from human intestinal bacteria and were studied their abilities to convert calycosin-7-O-β-d-glucoside. A total of six metabolites were identified in human incubated solution by ultra performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS). The results indicated that hydrolysis, demethylation, dehydroxylation and acetylation were the major metabolism of calycosin-7-O-β-d-glucoside. On the other hand, different strains of intestinal bacteria have varying degrees of growth sensitivity to calycosin-7-O-β-d-glucoside. Growth of certain pathogenic bacteria such as Enterobacter, Enterococcus, Clostridium and Bacteroides was significantly repressed by calycosin-7-O-β-d-glucoside, while commensal probiotics such as Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium were less severely affected. This indicates that calycosin-7-O-β-d-glucoside exert significant effects on the intestinal environment by modulation of the intestinal bacterial population. Our observation provided further evidence for the importance of intestinal bacteria in the metabolism, absorption and potential activity of calycosin-7-O-β-d-glucoside in human health and diseases. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",13.0

In the present study, the potential effects of Bifidobacterium longum CECT 7347 in children with newly diagnosed CD were evaluated. A double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in thirty-three children who received a capsule containing either B. longum CECT 7347 (109 colony-forming units) or placebo (excipients) daily for 3 months together with a gluten-free diet (GFD). Outcome measures (baseline and post-intervention) included immune phenotype of peripheral blood cells, serum cytokine concentration, faecal secretory IgA (sIgA) content, anthropometric parameters and intestinal microbiota composition. Comparisons between the groups revealed greater height percentile increases (P=0·048) in the B. longum CECT 7347 group than in the placebo group, as well as decreased peripheral CD3+ T lymphocytes (P=0·004) and slightly reduced TNF-α concentration (P=0·067). Within-group comparisons of baseline and final values did not reveal any differences in T lymphocytes and cytokines in the placebo group, while decreased CD3+ (P =0·013) and human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-DR+ T lymphocytes (P =0·029) and slightly reduced TNF-α concentration (P=0·085) were detected in the B. longum CECT 7347 group. Comparison between the groups showed that the administration of B. longum CECT 7347 reduced the numbers of the Bacteroides fragilis group (P=0·020) and the content of sIgA in stools (P=0·011) compared with the administration of placebo. Although this is a first exploratory intervention with limitations, the findings suggest that B. longum CECT 7347 could help improve the health status of CD patients who tend to show alterations in gut microbiota composition and a biased immune response even on a GFD.

It is a multifactorial disorder. Intestinal microbiota may cause the pathogenesis of IBS by contributing to abnormal gastrointestinal motility, low-grade inflammation, visceral hypersensitivity, communication in the gut-brain axis, and so on. Previous attempts to identify the intestinal microbiota composition in IBS patients have yielded inconsistent and occasionally contradictory results. This inconsistency may be due to the differences in the molecular techniques employed, the sample collection and handling methods, use of single samples that are not linked to fluctuating symptoms, or other factors such as patients' diets and phenotypic characterizations. Despite these difficulties, previous studies found that the intestinal microbiota in some IBS patients was completely different from that in healthy controls, and there does appear to be a consistent theme of Firmicutes enrichment and reduced abundance of Bacteroides. Based on the differences in intestinal microbiota composition, many studies have addressed the roles of microbiotatargeted treatments, such as antibiotics and probiotics, in alleviating certain symptoms of IBS. This review summarizes the current knowledge of the associations between intestinal microbiota and IBS as well as the possible modes of action of intestinal microbiota in the pathogenesis of IBS. Improving the current level of understanding of host-microbiota interactions in IBS is important not only for determining the role of intestinal microbiota in IBS pathogenesis but also for therapeutic modulation of the microbiota. © 2014 Baishideng Publishing Group Co., Limited.

Accumulating evidence has additionally associated intestinal bacteria with disease initiation and progression. In order to examine and analyze the composition of gut microbiota in the absence of confounding influences, we have established an animal model of 1, 2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH)-induced colon cancer. Using this model, we have performed pyrosequencing of the V3 region of the 16S rRNA genes in this study to determine the diversity and breadth of the intestinal microbial species. Our findings indicate that the microbial composition of the intestinal lumen differs significantly between control and tumor groups. The abundance of Firmicutes was elevated whereas the abundance of Bacteroidetes and Spirochetes was reduced in the lumen of CRC rats. Fusobacteria was not detected in any of the healthy rats and there was no significant difference in observed Proteobacteria species when comparing the bacterial communities between our two groups. Interestingly, the abundance of Proteobacteria was higher in CRC rats. At the genus level, Bacteroides exhibited a relatively higher abundance in CRC rats compared to controls (14.92% vs. 9.22%, p<0.001). Meanwhile, Prevotella (55.22% vs. 26.19%), Lactobacillus (3.71% vs. 2.32%) and Treponema (3.04% vs. 2.43%), were found to be significantly more abundant in healthy rats than CRC rats (p<0.001, respectively). We also demonstrate a significant reduction of butyrate-producing bacteria such as Roseburia and Eubacterium in the gut microbiota of CRC rats. Furthermore, a significant increase in Desulfovibrio, Erysipelotrichaceae and Fusobacterium was also observed in the tumor group. A decrease in probiotic species such as Ruminococcus and Lactobacillus was likewise observed in the tumor group. Collectively, we can conclude that a significant difference in intestinal bacterial flora exists between healthy rats and CRC rats. © 2014 Zhu et al.",120.0

The subjects largely consumed their habitual diet, but had to abstain from consuming dairy foods generally high in Ca. The subjects were randomised into the L. acidophilus (dose 109 colony-forming units twice daily; n 20) or the placebo (n 19) group. After an adaptation period of 2 weeks, the subjects were orally infected with a live, but attenuated, ETEC vaccine, able to induce mild, short-lived symptoms. Before and after the challenge, the subjects recorded stool consistency, bowel habits, and frequency and severity of gastrointestinal complaints. The ETEC challenge led to a significant increase in faecal output on the 2nd day and a concomitant increase in Bristol stool scale scores. Likewise, abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence, fever, headache and nausea peaked 1Â d after the oral challenge. The concentrations of faecal calprotectin and IgA peaked 2Â d after and that of serum IgM peaked 9 and 15Â d after the oral challenge. The concentrations of serum IgA and IgG were unaffected. The ETEC challenge led to a reduction in the number of Bacteroides-Prevotella, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium cluster XIVab and total faecal bacteria. Probiotic treatment was associated with a larger increase in Bristol stool scale scores and more fever, headache and nausea after the ETEC challenge compared with the placebo treatment. These differences were, however, small and with substantial variation within the groups. Oral application of an attenuated live ETEC vaccine provides a useful model for food-borne infections. Supplementation with L. acidophilus ATCC 700396, however, was ineffective in reducing ETEC infection symptoms in healthy men. © 2013 The Authors.",18.0

Administration of probiotics can reduce intestinal inflammation and the incidence of pulmonary exacerbations. We investigated the composition of intestinal microbiota in children with CF and analyzed its relationship with intestinal inflammation. We also investigated the microflora structure before and after Lactobacillus GG (LGG) administration in children with CF with and without antibiotic treatment. Methods: The intestinal microbiota were analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Intestinal inflammation was assessed by measuring fecal calprotectin (CLP) and rectal nitric oxide (rNO) production in children with CF as compared with healthy controls. We then carried out a small double-blind randomized clinical trial with LGG. Results: Twenty-two children with CF children were enrolled in the study (median age, 7 years; range, 2â€""9 years). Fecal CLP and rNO levels were higher in children with CF than in healthy controls (1846146 mg/g vs. 52646 mg/g; 18615 vs. 2.661.2 mmol/L NO2 2, respectively; P,0.01). Compared with healthy controls, children with CF had significantly different intestinal microbial core structures. The levels of Eubacterium rectale, Bacteroides uniformis, Bacteroides vulgatus, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium catenulatum, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were reduced in children with CF. A similar but more extreme pattern was observed in children with CF who were taking antibiotics. LGG administration reduced fecal CLP and partially restored intestinal microbiota. There was a significant correlation between reduced microbial richness and intestinal inflammation. Conclusions: CF causes qualitative and quantitative changes in intestinal microbiota, which may represent a novel therapeutic target in the treatment of CF. Administration of probiotics restored gut microbiota, supporting the efficacy of probiotics in reducing intestinal inflammation and pulmonary exacerbations. © 2014 Bruzzese et al.

Methods: Rats were fed 25 % fructose solution for hyperinsulinemia with L. casei Zhang for prevention or therapy. Serum levels of insulin, glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2), osteocalcin, malondialdehyde (MDA), total intestinal bile acids and hepatic glycogen contents were determined by assay kits. The major bacteria from feces and liver expression of adiponectin receptor 2 (AdipoR2), liver X receptor-α (LXR-α), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) and vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 mRNA were assessed by RT-PCR. Pancreas injury was evaluated by histological analysis. Results: Lactobacillus casei Zhang significantly increased numbers of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium and decreased Clostridium in the intestine (p < 0.01). Meanwhile, liver glycogen contents were significantly decreased (p < 0.05). In preventive group, accompanied by significantly lower insulin and GLP-2 levels (p < 0.05), L. casei Zhang prevented rats from an increase in oral glucose tolerance area under curve (AUC) which was significant in hyperinsulinemia group (p < 0.05). In therapeutic group, L. casei Zhang administration possessed improved glucose tolerance (p < 0.05), which were associated with increased osteocalcin level (p < 0.01), improved intestinal bile acids secretion (p = 0.060), decreased serum MDA levels (p < 0.05) and upregulation of LXR-α, PPAR-γ and AdipoR2 gene expression, as well as an increase in Bacteroides fragilis (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Lactobacillus casei Zhang administration exert both preventive and ameliorative effect on oral glucose tolerance AUC in IGT rats but may be via different mechanisms. L. casei Zhang could prevent rats from increased AUC through GLP-2 lowering, while the ameliorative effect in high-fructose-fed post-adolescent rats may be via B. fragilis enriched vitamin K2-dependent osteocalcin mechanism in which AdipoR2, LXR-α and PPAR-γ signaling were involved. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",55.0

RESULTS: The strain named Bifidobacterium bifidum WBIN03 with high growth rate and exopolysaccharide (EPS) yield was selected to study the effect of its EPS on modifying the intestinal microbiota of mice. The results indicated that EPS significantly increased the growth of lactobacilli and total anaerobic bacteria, and exerted their inhibition effect on the growth of enterobacteria, enterococci and Bacteroides fragilis. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis indicated that the EPS significantly increased the diversity of total bacteria and lactobacilli, but significantly decreased the diversity of enterobacteria. When receiving a low dose of EPS, Bacteroidales sp./Lactobacillus sp. occupied the dominant position, and L. johnsonii, L. animalis and L. reuteri were identified as the dominant strains when receiving a high concentration of EPS. CONCLUSION: The combination of viable cell count, DGGE and sequencing was used as an effective method to assess the microbial diversity in mouse intestine, and the benefit effect of EPS from B. bifidum WBIN03 on probiotics and antagonistic effect against pathogens would guaranteed the health of their hosts. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry.",22.0

The present study investigated whether viable strains of gut-associated obligate anaerobes are shared between the maternal and neonatal gut ecosystem via breastfeeding. Maternal faeces, breast milk and corresponding neonatal faeces collected from seven mothers-neonate pairs at three neonatal sampling points were analyzed by culture-independent (pyrosequencing) and culture-dependent methods (16S rRNA gene sequencing, pulsed field gel electrophoresis, random amplified polymorphic DNA and repetitive extragenic palindromic polymerase chain reaction. Pyrosequencing allowed identifying gut-associated obligate anaerobic genera, like Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, Parabacteroides and members of the Clostridia (Blautia, Clostridium, Collinsella and Veillonella) shared between maternal faeces, breast milk and neonatal faeces. Using culture, a viable strain of Bifidobacterium breve was shown to be shared between all three ecosystems within one mother-neonate pair. Furthermore, pyrosequencing revealed that several butyrate-producing members of the Clostridia (Coprococcus, Faecalibacterium, Roseburia and Subdoligranulum) were shared between maternal faeces and breast milk. This study shows that (viable) obligate gut-associated anaerobes may be vertically transferred from mother to neonate via breastfeeding. Thus, our data support the recently suggested hypothesis of a novel way of mother-neonate communication, in which maternal gut bacteria reach breast milk via an entero-mammary pathway to influence neonatal gut colonization and maturation of the immune system. © 2013 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",294.0

Especially, ""Yakult"", a fermented milk beverage containing 6.5 billion live LcS, is drunk in more than 32 countries and regions worldwide, including in Japan, with more than 30 million products being provided to the market each day. This widespread mass consumption of this probiotic product has been achieved with the help of product delivery and sales staff. They provide the fresh probiotic drink to customers each day, and naturally they personally consume this probiotic beverage at high rates. Assuming that the effect of probiotics in improving intestinal microbiota would be observable in the staff routinely consuming the products, we compared the intestinal microbiota of 91 staff with that of 98 women from the general population who were not in the habit of drinking probiotic products. We found that 1) the frequencies of detection of LcS and BbrY in the feces were higher in the staff than in the general group of women; 2) counts of bacteria, including Bifidobacterium, the Clostridium coccoides group, the Bacteroides fragilis group, Enterococcus, and Lactobacillus, were significantly higher in the staff group than in the general group, whereas the frequencies of detection and counts of Prevotella, Staphylococcus, and C. perfringens were significantly lower in the staff group than in the general group; 3) the stools of the staff group were significantly softer than those of the general group. These results suggested that regular drinking of probiotic products improved the intestinal microbiota and bowel habit in these staff. Copyright © 2014 by New Century Health Publishers, LLC.",3.0

However, the route and metabolites of liquiritin by human intestinal microflora are not well understood and its metabolites may accumulate to exert physiological effects. Therefore, our objective was to screen the ability of the bacteria to metabolize liquiritin and assess the effect of this compound on the intestinal bacteria. Finally, six strains, comprising Bacteroides sp. 22 and sp.57, Veillonella sp. 31 and sp.48, Bacillus sp. 46 and Clostridium sp. 51, were isolated and their abilities to convert liquiritin studied. A total of five metabolites were identified using ultra performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry in human incubated solution. The results indicated that hydrolysis, hydrogenation, methylation, deoxygenation and acetylation were the major routes of metabolism of liquiritin. On the other hand, effect of liquiritin on different strains of intestinal bacteria growth was detected using an Emax precision microplate reader. Growth of certain pathogenic bacteria, such as Enterobacter, Enterococcus, Clostridium and Bacteroides, was significantly repressed by liquiritin, while growth of commensal probiotics such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium was less severely affected. Our observation provided further evidence for the importance of intestinal bacteria in the metabolism, and the potential activity of liquiritin in human health and disease. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",23.0

Many bacteria are capable, however, of producing β-lactamase enzymes that inactivate β-lactam antibiotics. We hypothesized that prior establishment of intestinal colonization with a β-lactamaseproducing anaerobe might prevent these adverse effects of β-lactam antibiotics, by inactivating the portion of antibiotic that is excreted into the intestinal tract. Here, mice with a previously abolished microbiota received either oral normal saline or an oral cephalosporinase- producing strain of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron for 3 days. Mice then received 3 days of subcutaneous ceftriaxone, followed by either oral administration of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) or sacrifice and assessment of in vitro growth of epidemic and nonepidemic strains of Clostridium difficile in murine cecal contents. Stool concentrations of VRE and ceftriaxone were measured, cecal levels of C. difficile 24 h after incubation were quantified, and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of microbial 16S rRNA genes was performed to evaluate the antibiotic effect on the microbiota. The results demonstrated that establishment of prior colonization with a β-lactamase-producing intestinal anaerobe inactivated intraintestinal ceftriaxone during treatment with this antibiotic, allowed recovery of the normal microbiota despite systemic ceftriaxone, and prevented overgrowth with VRE and epidemic and nonepidemic strains of C. difficile in mice. These findings describe a novel probiotic strategy to potentially prevent pathogen colonization in hospitalized patients. Copyright © 2014, American Society for Microbiology.

Since amixicile selectively inhibits the action of a B vitamin (thiamine pyrophosphate) cofactor of pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR), it may both escape mutation-based drug resistance and spare beneficial probiotic gut bacteria that do not express this enzyme. Amixicile is a water-soluble derivative of nitazoxanide (NTZ), an antiparasitic therapeutic that also shows efficacy against CDI in humans. In comparative studies, amixicile showed no toxicity to hepatocytes at 200 μM(NTZ was toxic above 10 μM); was not metabolized by human, dog, or rat liver microsomes; showed equivalence or superiority to NTZ in cytochrome P450 assays; and did not activate efflux pumps (breast cancer resistance protein, P glycoprotein). A maximum dose (300 mg/kg) of amixicile given by the oral or intraperitoneal route was well tolerated by mice and rats. Plasma exposure (rats) based on the area under the plasma concentration-time curve was 79.3 h · μg/ml (30 mg/kg dose) to 328 h · μg/ml (100 mg/kg dose), the maximum concentration of the drug in serum was 20 μg/ml, the time to the maximum concentration of the drug in serum was 0.5 to 1 h, and the half-life was 5.6 h. Amixicile did not concentrate in mouse feces or adversely affect gut populations of Bacteroides species, Firmicutes, segmented filamentous bacteria, or Lactobacillus species. Systemic bioavailability was demonstrated through eradication of Helicobacter pylori in a mouse infection model. In summary, the efficacy of amixicile in treating CDI and other infections, together with low toxicity, an absence of mutation-based drug resistance, and excellent drug metabolism and pharmacokinetic metrics, suggests a potential for broad application in the treatment of infections caused by PFOR-expressing microbial pathogens in addition to CDI.

This work has evaluated the impact on the gut microbiota of long-term feeding with both a red wine polyphenolic extract and the flavan-3-ol metabolizer strain Lactobacillus plantarum IFPL935. The study was conducted in the dynamic Simulator of the Human Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem (SHIME). The feeding of the gut microbiota model with red wine polyphenols caused an initial decrease in the counts of total bacteria in the ascending colon (AC), with Bacteroides, Clostridium coccoides/Eubacterium rectale and Bifidobacterium being the most affected bacterial groups. The bacterial counts recovered to initial numbers faster than the overall microbial fermentation and proteolysis, which seemed to be longer affected by polyphenols. Addition of L. plantarum IFPL935 helped to promptly recover total counts, Lactobacillus and Enterobacteriaceae and led to an increase in lactic acid formation in the AC vessel at the start of the polyphenol treatment as well as butyric acid in the transverse (TC) and descending (DC) vessels after 5 days. Moreover, L. plantarum IFPL935 favoured the conversion in the DC vessel of monomeric flavan-3-ols and their intermediate metabolites into phenylpropionic acids and in particular 3-(3′- hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid. The results open the possibilities of using L. plantarum IFPL935 as a food ingredient for helping individuals showing a low polyphenol-fermenting metabotype to increase their colonic microbial capacities of metabolizing dietary polyphenols. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.",29.0

This symbiotic relationship between host and microbiota has a significant impact on shaping the immune response in the host to achieve an immune tolerance to microbiota but retaining the ability to respond to invading pathogens. Perturbation of this balance by manipulation of microbial communities in the host can lead to immune dysregulation and susceptibility to diseases. By studying the host in the absence of microbiota or with alteration of microbiota the complexity of microbial impact on the immune system can be resolved. Conversely, the study of microbiota in the absence of immune system factors can show how the immune system contributes to preservation of the host-microbiota balance. The absence of molecules involved in innate or adaptive immunity in knockout models can perturb the balance between host and microbiota further adding to more immune dysregulation. A better understanding of Microbiome-immune system interaction provides a new opportunity to identify biomarkers and drug targets. This will allow the development of new therapeutic agents for modulating the immune system to improve health with little or no toxicity. The study of interplay between host and microbiota has a promising role in the design of therapeutic interventions for immunopathological diseases arising from imbalanced host and microbiota interactions. © 2014 Bentham Science Publishers.",19.0

Among them, the use of antibiotics on the mother during labor, referred to as intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP), has scarcely been investigated, although this practice is routinely used in group B Streptococcus (GBS)-positive women. This work is therefore aimed at verifying whether IAP can influence the main microbial groups of the newborn gut microbiota at an early stage of microbial establishment. Fifty-two newborns were recruited: 26 born by mothers negative to GBS (control group) and 26 by mothers positive to GBS and subjected to IAP with ampicillin (IAP group). Selected microbial groups (Lactobacillus spp., Bidobacterium spp., Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium difficile, and Escherichia coli) were quantified with real-time PCR on DNA extracted from newborn feces. Further analysis was performed within the Bidobacterium genus by using DGGE after amplification with genus-specific primers. Results obtained showed a significant decrease of the bifidobacteria counts after antibiotic treatment of the mother. Bifidobacteria were found to be affected by IAP not only quantitatively but also qualitatively. In fact, IAP determined a decrement in the frequency of Bidobacterium breve, Bidobacterium bifidum, and Bidobacterium dentium with respect to the control group. Moreover, this study has preliminarily evaluated that some bifidobacterial strains, previously selected for use in infants, have antibacterial properties against GBS and are therefore potential candidates for being applied as probiotics for the prevention of GBS infections. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.",86.0

To monitor the effects on microbial community composition, plate counts on specific growth media and a PCR-DGGE analysis were performed on samples from all colon compartments - ascending, transverse and descending. To verify the effects on microbial metabolism, we analyzed the ammonium and short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) concentrations. The synbiotic beverage showed the best microbiological results in the ascending colon compartment, stimulating the growth of Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacterium spp., and reducing Clostridium spp., Bacteroides spp., enterobacteria and Enterococcus spp. populations in this compartment. A larger reduction (p. <. 0.05) of ammonia ions in the ascending colon was observed during the synbiotic beverage treatment. No statistical difference was observed in SCFA production among the treatments and the basal period. Plate count and DGGE analysis showed the survival of L. casei Lc-01 in the colon.

Few long term follow-up studies have been reported and we therefore characterized the development of intestinal microbiota of ten subjects from the 2nd week of life to 13 years of age. PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis combined with several bacterial group-specific primer sets demonstrated the colonization steps of defined bacterial groups in the microbiota. Bifidobacterium species were seen throughout the test period in all subjects. Bacteroides fragilis group and Blautia coccoides-Eubacterium rectale group species were not detected in several subjects during the first 6 months of life but were commonly seen after 12 months of life. Streptococcus group appeared during early life but was not seen in several subjects at the age of 13 years. Although a few species were linked with the increasing age, major bacterial species in the groups did not change dramatically. Rather considerable changes were found in the relative abundances of each bacterial species. Clustering analysis of total bacterial flora indicated that the microbiota changed considerably between 6 months and 12 months of life, and, at the age of 12 months, the intestinal microbiota was already converted toward a profile characteristic of an adult microbiota.

Although the intestinal microbial community exists in a state of homeostasis called eubiosis, environmental and genetics factors can lead to microbial perturbation or dysbiosis, a state associated with various pathologies including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and colorectal cancer (CRC). Dysbiotic microbiota is thought to contribute to the initiation and progression of CRC. At the opposite end of the spectrum, two recently published studies in Science reveal that the microbiota is essential for chemotherapeutic drug efficacy, suggesting a beneficial microbial function in cancer management. The dichotomy between the beneficial and detrimental roles of the microbiota during cancer initiation, progression, and treatment emphasize the interwoven relationship between bacteria and cancer. Moreover, these findings suggest that the microbiota could be considered as a therapeutic target, not only at the level of cancer prevention, but also during management, i.e. by enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapeutics. The intestinal microbiota plays an essential role in the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis, and disrupted microbial functions are often associated with intestinal pathology such as colorectal cancer (CRC).

However, it has never been tested in any human trial. In the current study, the impact of oral consumption of LcZ on different age groups was tested. Chinese subjects, including 10 young, 7 middle-aged and 7 elderly volunteers (with mean age of 24.3, 47.6 and 64.7, respectively), were recruited. Each subject took 10.6 log10 cfu LcZ daily for a continuous period of 28 days. Several parameters, including the amounts of LcZ and four selected groups of bacteria, change of bacterial diversity, short chain fatty acids (SCFA) and total bile acids (TBA), were monitored in faecal samples collected from the subjects before starting, during and after stopping oral LcZ consumption. The consumption of LcZ exhibited beneficial effects to the subjects by modulating faecal microbiota in a temporal manner with a prolonged elevation of SCFA and reduction of TBA. The potentially harmful Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter genera were suppressed by the probiotic administration. Furthermore, a moderately divergent response was observed in the indigenous gut populations of Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides fragilis group in different age subjects.

The culture-dependent approach revealed that the numbers of gut bacteria of silkworm in the BRW significantly decreased compared with that of the TRW. The analysis of clone libraries showed that the gut microbiota in the BRW was significantly less diverse than that in the TRW. Acinetobacter and Bacteroides were dominant populations in the BRW, and Bacillus and Arcobacter dominated in the TRW. DGGE profiles confirmed the difference of silkworm gut bacterial community between two rearing ways.

Samples were collected before the overfeeding period (at 12 wk), at 13 wk (meal 12 of overfeeding), and at 14 wk (meal 24), 3 h postfeeding. Whatever the digestive segment and the level of intake, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria were the dominant phyla in the bacterial community of mule ducks (at least 90%). Before overfeeding, ileal samples were dominated by Clostridia, Bacteroidia, and Gammaproteobacteria (80% and up), and cecal samples by Bacteroidia and Clostridia (around 85%). The richness and diversity decreased in the ileum and increased in the ceca after overfeeding. Overfeeding increased the relative abundance of Firmicutes and especially the Lactobacillus group in ileal samples. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling profiles separated the bacterial communities with respect to overfeeding only in cecal samples. Richness indicators decreased after L. sakei has been added at mid-overfeeding only in the ileum. In the ceca, the decrease of these indexes only occurred at the end of overfeeding.

In patients with inflammatory bowel diseases, the mucosal immune system has inappropriate interactions with the intestinal microbiota. We investigated how the composition of the intestinal microbiota affects its endotoxicity and development of colitis in mice. Methods Germ-free C57BL/6J-Rag1tm1Mom (Rag1-/-) mice were colonized with 2 different types of complex intestinal microbiota. Colitis was induced in Rag1-/- mice by transfer of CD4+CD62L+ T cells from C57BL/6J mice. Colonic tissues were collected and used for histologic analysis and cell isolation. Activation of lamina propria dendritic cells and T cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. Results After transfer of CD4 +CD62L+ T cells, mice with intestinal Endolo microbiota (a low proportion of Enterobacteriaceae, high proportion of Bacteroidetes, and low endotoxicity) maintained mucosal immune homeostasis, and mice with highly endotoxic Endohi microbiota (a high proportion of Enterobacteriaceae and low proportion of Bacteroidetes) developed colitis. To determine whether the effects of Endohi microbiota were related to the higher endotoxic activity of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), we compared LPS from Enterobacteriaceae with that of Bacteroidetes. Administration of Escherichia coli JM83 (wild-type LPS) to the mice exacerbated colitis, and Escherichia coli JM83 + htrBPG (mutated LPS, with lower endotoxicity, similar to that of Bacteroidetes) prevented development of colitis after transfer of the T cells to mice. Conclusions The endotoxicity of LPS produced by the intestinal microbiota is a determinant of whether mice develop colitis after transfer of CD4 +CD62L+ T cells.

TLR9 recognizes unmethylated CpG motifs in bacterial DNA, and TLR9 signalling maintains the gut epithelial homeostasis. Here, we carried out a bioinformatic analysis of the frequency of CpG motifs in the genomes of gut commensal bacteria across major bacterial phyla. The frequency of potentially immunostimulatory CpG motifs (all CpG hexamers) or purine-purine-CG-pyrimidine-pyrimidine hexamers was linearly dependent on the genomic G+C content. We found that species belonging to Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria (including bifidobacteria) carried high counts of GTCGTT, the optimal motif stimulating human TLR9. We also found that Enterococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus rhamnosus, whose strains have been marketed as probiotics, had high counts of GTCGTT motifs. As gut bacterial species differ significantly in their genomic content of CpG motifs, the overall load of CpG motifs in the intestine depends on the species assembly of microbiota and their cell numbers. The optimal CpG motif content of microbiota may depend on the host's physiological status and, consequently, on an adequate level of TLR9 signalling. We speculate that microbiota with increased numbers of microbes with CpG motif-rich DNA could better support mucosal functions in healthy individuals and improve the T-helper 1 (Th1)/Th2 imbalance in allergic diseases. In autoimmune disorders, CpG motif-rich DNA could, however, further increase the Th1-type immune responsiveness. Estimation of the load of microbe-associated molecular patterns, including CpG motifs, in gut microbiota could shed new light on host-microbe interactions across a range of diseases. © 2014 SGM.",40.0

For microbiological and immunological analysis, blood samples were obtained at the 24th hour, and peritoneal fluid samples were obtained at the 24th and 72nd hours. On the fifth day after surgery, all rats were sacrificed, and the macroscopic findings of the peritoneal cavity were recorded. Results: The mean number of intraperitoneal abscesses was significantly higher in the control group and the lowest in the twotreatment group (A+T). The levels of cytokines were not significantly different between groups. Giving tPA reduced the number and sizes of the abscesses with no significant difference in inflammatory response. Conclusion: In this experimental peritonitis model, it can be postulated that tPA decreased abscess formation without exaggerating the inflammatory response. © 2014 TJTES.",
Hsieh M.H.,The microbiome and probiotics in childhood,2014,Seminars in Reproductive Medicine,10.1055/s-0033-1361819,"Infants, from the moment of birth, are colonized by large numbers of microbes. This colonization continues throughout childhood and from preliminary studies seems to be a highly dynamic process, even during the usual physiologic state we refer to as health. In this context, the persistence of bacterial and fungal species in and on the human body likely confers various benefits to the host. One specific approach to modulate such beneficial effects is the administration of probiotics, also known as beneficial microbes. Herein, we outline the highest level evidence in regard to the evolution of the microbiome during childhood and its manipulation by probiotics for genitourinary, enteric, and allergic and atopic disorders. Thus, probiotic approaches are promising alternatives and adjuvants to traditional vaccines and antibiotics. This may usher in a new age in which vaccine and antibiotic side effects and antibiotic resistance are minimal issues in the setting of maintaining children's health and prevention of disease.© 2014 by Thieme Medical Publishers.",3.0

We demonstrate GI barrier defects and microbiota alterations in the maternal immune activation (MIA) mouse model that is known to display features of ASD. Oral treatment of MIA offspring with the human commensal Bacteroides fragilis corrects gut permeability, alters microbial composition, and ameliorates defects in communicative, stereotypic, anxiety-like and sensorimotor behaviors. MIA offspring display an altered serum metabolomic profile, and B. fragilis modulates levels of several metabolites. Treating naive mice with a metabolite that is increased by MIA and restored by B. fragilis causes certain behavioral abnormalities, suggesting that gut bacterial effects on the host metabolome impact behavior. Taken together, these findings support a gut-microbiome-brain connection in a mouse model of ASD and identify a potential probiotic therapy for GI and particular behavioral symptoms in human neurodevelopmental disorders.

Bifidobacterium longum NB667 and Bifidobacterium breve IPLA20004 grew in glucose but showed poor or no growth in complex carbohydrates (inulin, EPS E44, and EPS R1), whereas Bacteroides grew well in the four carbon sources tested. In the presence of glucose, the growth of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron DSM-2079 was inhibited by B. breve, whereas it remained unaffected in the presence of B. longum. Ba. fragilis DSM-2151 contributed to a greater survival of B. longum, promoting changes in the synthesis of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and organic acids in coculture with respect to monocultures. In complex carbohydrates, cocultures of bifidobacterium strains with Ba. thetaiotaomicron did not modify the behavior of Bacteroides nor improve the poor growth of bifidobacteria. The metabolic activity of Ba. fragilis in coculture with bifidobacteria was not affected by EPS, but greater survival of bifidobacteria at late stages of incubation occurred in cocultures than in monocultures, leading to a higher production of acetic acid than in monocultures. Therefore, cocultures of Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides can behave differently against fermentable carbohydrates as a function of the specific characteristics of the strains from each species. These results stress the importance of considering specific species and strain interactions and not simply higher taxonomic divisions in the relationship among intestinal microbial populations and their different responses to probiotics and prebiotics. © 2013, American Society for Microbiology.",57.0

Previously reported clinical studies showed no effect of Ls-33 consumption on the metabolic syndrome in the subject group. The aim of the study was to investigate the impact of L. salivarius Ls-33 on fecal microbiota in obese adolescents. Methods: The study was a double-blinded intervention with 50 subjects randomized to intake of L. salivarius Ls-33 or placebo for 12 weeks. The fecal microbiota was assessed by real-time quantitative PCR before and after intervention. Concentrations of fecal short chain fatty acids were determined using gas chromatography. Results: Ratios of Bacteroides-Prevotella-Porphyromonas group to Firmicutes belonging bacteria, including Clostridium cluster XIV, Blautia coccoides_. Eubacteria rectale group and Roseburia intestinalis, were significantly increased (p≤0.05) after administration of Ls-33. The cell numbers of fecal bacteria, including the groups above as well as Clostridium cluster I, Clostridium cluster IV, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcus, the Lactobacillus group and Bifidobacterium were not significantly altered by intervention. Similarly, short chain fatty acids remained unaffected.

Allan Walker W.,Initial intestinal colonization in the human infant and immune homeostasis,2013,Annals of Nutrition and Metabolism,10.1159/000354907,"The paradigm of disease burden in the developed world has changed drastically in the last few decades from predominately infections to immune-mediated diseases (autoimmunity and allergy) because of alterations in the Western lifestyle (improved sanitation, immunizations, antibiotic usage and altered dietary intake). A diverse balanced microbiota is necessary for the development of an appropriate innate and adaptive immune response. There is strong evidence that disruption of the normal colonization process can lead to alterations in the important symbiotic relationship that is necessary for immune homeostasis. For example, infants born by cesarean section or receiving excessive perinatal antibiotics have inadequate initial colonization and aberrant mucosal immune function. As a result, later in childhood, they express an increased incidence in asthma and autoimmune diseases (e.g. celiac disease). An important component of initial colonization is the infant's diet. Breast milk contains a variety of nondigestible oligosaccharides which function as prebiotics preferentially stimulating proliferation of Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli, important health-promoting bacteria, and cause fermentation of the oligosaccharides into short-chain fatty acids. In the absence of breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life, formula containing pre- and probiotics may overcome an initial inadequate colonization process and help establish a normal mucosal immune system. © 2013 S.

The impact of probiotic intake on bacterial community profile as well as effect on the variation of some indicator fecal microbiota species were assessed on fecal DNA samples obtained during the clinical trial of a commercial yogurt. T-RFLP of fecal samples showed no difference in profile variation between placebo or yogurt consumption (Bray-Curtis distance). Quantification by qPCR of some elements of fecal populations and endogenous Bifidobacterium species revealed that beyond the increase in probiotic species (. Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis and Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-5), the variations observed were largely due to inter-subject variation rather than treatment effect.

Recent advances in sequencing technologies and new bioinformatic possibilities now allow investigating the microbes that colonize the human gut, skin and airways in more detail. In light of the hygiene hypothesis, the impact of the microbial composition of individuals with allergic sensitization and/or atopic diseases, i.e., allergic asthma or atopic eczema, were investigated in several clinical trials. Altered diversity of gut microbiota during infancy as well as colonization with specific pathogenic and apathogenic bacteria has been linked with an elevated risk for allergy. There are ongoing attempts to establish intervention strategies aimed at modifying initial colonization patterns in early life.

On the other hand, the population level of clostridia decreased in the large intestine. The proportion of bacteria that are able to ferment saccharides and produce short-chain fatty acids increased in the small intestine and decreased in the large intestine. Importantly, population level of probiotic lactobacilli and bacteria exhibiting the immunomodulatory effect increased in the PG-administered mice.

They are also potential therapeutic proteins for inflammatory bowel disease. However, owing to protein instability in the upper gastrointestinal tract, it is difficult to achieve therapeutic levels of these proteins in the injured colon when given orally. Furthermore, the short half-life necessitates repeated dosage with large amounts of the growth factor, which may have dangerous side effects, hence the importance of temporal and spatial control of growth factor delivery. METHODS The human commensal gut bacterium, Bacteroides ovatus, was genetically engineered to produce human KGF-2 or TGF-β1 (BO-KGF or BO-TGF) in a regulated manner in response to the dietary polysaccharide, xylan. The successful application of BO-KGF or BO-TGF in the prevention of dextran sodium sulphate induced murine colitis is presented here. RESULTS This novel drug delivery system had a significant prophylactic effect, limiting the development of intestinal inflammation both clinically and histopathologically. The ability to regulate heterologous protein production by B ovatus using xylan is both unique and an important safety feature of this drug delivery system.

The cholesterol-lowering effects of lactic acid bacteria have recently become an area of great interest and controversy for many researchers. In this study, we investigated the effects of two NS lactobacillus strains, Lactobacillus plantarum NS5 and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus NS12, on lipid metabolism of rats fed a high cholesterol diet. Methods. Thirty-two SD rats were assigned to four groups and fed either a normal or a high-cholesterol diet. The NS lactobacillus treated groups received the high-cholesterol diet supplemented with Lactobacillus plantarum NS5 or Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus NS12 in drinking water. The rats were sacrificed after a 6-week feeding period. Body weights, visceral organ and fat weights, serum and liver cholesterol and lipid levels, intestinal microbiota and liver mRNA expression levels related to cholesterol metabolism were analyzed. Liver lipid deposition and adipocyte size were evaluated histologically. Results: Compared with rats fed a high cholesterol diet, serum total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein B and free fatty acids levels were decreased and apolipoprotein A-I level was increased in NS5 or NS12 strain treated rats, and with no significant change in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level. Liver cholesterol and triglyceride levels were also significantly decreased in NS lactobacillus strains treated groups. Meanwhile, the NS lactobacillus strains obviously alleviated hepatic injuries, decreased liver lipid deposition and reduced adipocyte size of high cholesterol diet fed rats. NS lactobacillus strains restored the changes in intestinal microbiota compositions, such as the increase in Bacteroides and the decrease in Clostridium. NS lactobacillus strains also regulated the mRNA expression levels of liver enzymes related to cholesterol metabolism, including the down regulation of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) and the upregulation of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1). Conclusion: This study suggested that the two NS lactobacillus strains may affect lipid metabolism and have cholesterol-lowering effects in rats fed a high cholesterol diet. © 2013 Hu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",38.0

Nineteen structurally well-defined candidate OS covering groups of β-glucosides, α-glucosides and α-galactosides with degree of polymerization 2-4 were prepared in >100 mg amounts by chemoenzymatic synthesis (i.e. reverse phosphorolysis or transglycosylation). Fourteen of the OS are not naturally occurring and five (β-d-glucosyl-fructose, β-d-glucosyl-xylitol, α-glucosyl-(1,4)- d-mannose, α-glucosyl-(1,4)-d-xylose; α-glucosyl-(1,4)-l-fucose) have recently been synthesized for the first time. These OS have not been previously tested for effects of bacterial growth and here the ability of all 19 OS to support growth of four gastrointestinal bacteria: three probiotic bacteria Bifidobacterium lactis, Bifidobacterium longum, and Lactobacillus acidophilus, and one commensal bacterium, Bacteroides vulgatus has been evaluated in monocultures. The disaccharides β-d-glucosyl-xylitol and β-d-glucosyl-(1,4)-xylose noticeably stimulated growth yields of L. acidophilus NCFM, and additionally, β-d-glucosyl-(1,4)-xylose stimulated B. longum Bl-05. α-Glucosyl-(1,4)-glucosamine and α-glucosyl-(1,4)-N- acetyl-glucosamine enhanced the growth rate of B. animalis subsp. lactis and B. longum Bl-05, whereas L. acidophilus NCFM and Bac. vulgatus did not grow on these OS. α-Galactosyl-(1,6)-α-galactosyl-(1,6)-glucose advanced the growth rate of B. animalis subsp. lactis and L. acidophilus NCFM. Thus several of the structurally well-defined OS supported growth of beneficial gut bacteria. This reflects a broad specificity of their sugar transporters for OS, including specificity for non-naturally occurring OS, hence showing promise for design of novel prebiotics. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",14.0

Our aim was to compare the fecal microbiota of healthy children with that of children with clinical diarrhea in a population from a tropical highland in Colombia, South America. Our hypothesis was that a reduced prevalence of inherent Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species would be associated with enteric viral and bacterial pathogens. METHODS: Children between 1 and 5 years of age from 2 different locations were evaluated for presence of clinical diarrhea. Nucleic acid, isolated from fecal samples, was used to determine by molecular protocols the abundance of inherent bacterial species and presence of enteric pathogens compared with clinically healthy children. The effect of host demographic factors on incidence of diarrhea was also analyzed. RESULTS: The composition of the fecal microbiota was affected by host demographic factors: age, health status, location, and sex. In partial support of our hypothesis, the relative abundance of commensal Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus species was inversely correlated with incidence of diarrhea regardless of location. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested that changes in fecal microbiota composition of children with clinical diarrhea are associated with certain demographic factors that should be considered before designing a prophylactic intervention. Delivery of certain Lactobacillus species and Bifidobacterium species or a diet rich in bifidogenic components that promote growth of Bifidobacterium species could provide a prophylactic effect to ameliorate the effect of diarrhea in children at risk.

Methods: Twenty-nine colicky infants (age 10-60 days) were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive either Lactobacillus reuteri (108 cfu) or a placebo once daily for 21 days. Responders were defined as subjects with a decrease of 50% in daily crying time at day 21 compared with the starting point. The microbiota of faecal samples from day 1 and 21 were analyzed using 454 pyrosequencing. The primers: Bakt_341F and Bakt_805R, complemented with 454 adapters and sample specific barcodes were used for PCR amplification of the 16 S rRNA genes. The structure of the data was explored by using permutational multivariate analysis of variance and effects of different variables were visualized with ordination analysis. Results: The infants' faecal microbiota were composed of Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes as the four main phyla. The composition of the microbiota in infants with colic had very high inter-individual variability with Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratios varying from 4000 to 0.025. On an individual basis, the microbiota was, however, relatively stable over time. Treatment with L. reuteri DSM 17938 did not change the global composition of the microbiota, but when comparing responders with non-responders the group responders had an increased relative abundance of the phyla Bacteroidetes and genus Bacteroides at day 21 compared with day 0. Furthermore, the phyla composition of the infants at day 21 could be divided into three enterotype groups, dominated by Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria, respectively. Conclusion: L. reuteri DSM 17938 did not affect the global composition of the microbiota. However, the increase of Bacteroidetes in the responder infants indicated that a decrease in colicky symptoms was linked to changes of the microbiota.

A multitude of diseases including diarrhoea, gastrointestinal inflammatory disorders, such as necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) of neonates, and obesity are linked to microbial composition and metabolic activity. Therefore, research on possible dietary strategies influencing microbial composition and activity, both preventive and curative, is being accomplished. Interest has focused on pre- and probiotics that stimulate the intestinal production of beneficial bacterial metabolites such as butyrate, and beneficially affect microbial composition. The suitability of an animal model to study dietary linked diseases is of much concern. The physiological similarity between humans and pigs in terms of digestive and associated metabolic processes places the pig in a superior position over other non-primate models. Furthermore, the pig is a human-sized omnivorous animal with comparable nutritional requirements, and shows similarities to the human intestinal microbial ecosystem. Also, the pig has been used as a model to assess microbiota-health interactions, since pigs exhibit similar syndromes to humans, such as NEC and partly weanling diarrhoea. In contrast, when using rodent models to study diet-microbiota-health interactions, differences between rodents and humans have to be considered. For example, studies with mice and human subjects assessing possible relationships between the composition and metabolic activity of the gut microbiota and the development of obesity have shown inconsistencies in results between studies. The present review displays the similarities and differences in intestinal microbial ecology between humans and pigs, scrutinising the pig as a potential animal model, with regard to possible health effects. © The Author 2013.",178.0

Probiotic bacteria appear to be therapeutically effective. We characterized the mucosa-associated microbiota, and determined the clinical and microbiological effects of orally administered probiotic bacteria, in patients with IBS. Methods: Mucosal microbiota from rectal biopsies of IBS patients and controls were assessed on the V1 and V2 variable regions of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplified using 454 pyrosequencing. Clinical symptoms and changes in mucosal microbiota were assessed in IBS patients before and after 4 weeks of treatment with probiotic mix VSL#3. Results: Ten IBS subjects (eight female; mean age 46 years) were included. At week 4 of probiotic therapy, six patients showed symptom improvement on global symptom assessment compared with baseline (P=0.031). Before therapy, intestinal microbiota of IBS subjects differed significantly from that of healthy controls, with less diversity and evenness than controls (n=9; P<0.05), increased abundance of Bacteroidetes (P=0.014) and Synegitestes (P=0.017), and reduced abundance of Actinobacteria (P=0.004). The classes Flavobacteria (P=0.028) and Epsilonproteobacteria (P=0.017) were less enriched in IBS. Abundance differences were largely consistent from the phylum to genus level. Probiotic treatment in IBS patients was associated with a significant reduction of the genus Bacteroides (all taxonomy levels; P<0.05) to levels similar to that of controls. Conclusion: In this pilot study, global and deep molecular analysis demonstrates an altered mucosal microbiota composition in IBS. Probiotic leads to detectable changes in the microbiota.

Vaishnavi C.,Translocation of gut flora and its role in sepsis,2013,Indian Journal of Medical Microbiology,10.4103/0255-0857.118870,"Bacterial translocation is the invasion of indigenous intestinal bacteria through the gut mucosa to normally sterile tissues and the internal organs. Sometimes instead of bacteria, inflammatory compounds are responsible for clinical symptoms as in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). The difference between sepsis and SIRS is that pathogenic bacteria are isolated from patients with sepsis but not with those of SIRS. Bacterial translocation occurs more frequently in patients with intestinal obstruction and in immunocompromised patients and is the cause of subsequent sepsis. Factors that can trigger bacterial translocation from the gut are host immune deficiencies and immunosuppression, disturbances in normal ecological balance of gut, mucosal barrier permeability, obstructive jaundice, stress, etc. Bacterial translocation occurs through the transcellular and the paracellular pathways and can be measured both directly by culture of mesenteric lymph nodes and indirectly by using labeled bacteria, peripheral blood culture, detection of microbial DNA or endotoxin and urinary excretion of non-metabolisable sugars. Bacterial translocation may be a normal phenomenon occurring on frequent basis in healthy individuals without any deleterious consequences. But when the immune system is challenged extensively, it breaks down and results in septic complications at different sites away from the main focus. The factors released from the gut and carried in the mesenteric lymphatics but not in the portal blood are enough to cause multi-organ failure. Thus, bacterial translocation may be a promoter of sepsis but not the initiator. This paper reviews literature on the translocation of gut flora and its role in causing sepsis.",88.0

Here, we investigated functional interactions with respect to the anti-inflammatory activity between flavonols and probiotic bacteria. Ten enteric (6 probiotic and 4 indigenous) bacteria were incubated with flavonols (galangin, kaempferol, quercetin, myricetin, and fisetin) under anaerobic conditions, and the supernatants were assessed for their effects on nitric oxide (NO) production in lipopolysaccaride-stimulated RAW264 cells. Although the conditioned medium from the flavonol mono-culture and almost all of the tested co-cultures failed to inhibit NO production, the medium from the Bifidobacterium adolescentis/flavonols (galangin, quercetin, and fisetin) co-culture highly suppressed NO production. This activity increased during the 1-6 H incubation in a time-dependent manner and was not observed in the co-culture using heat-inactivated B. adolescentis. Interestingly, when the B. adolescentis cell number was increased, the supernatant from the mono-culture of the bacteria showed NO suppression, suggesting that B. adolescentis may produce NO suppressant(s), and flavonols may have a promoting effect.

Both secondary lymphoid tissue, such as Peyer's patches, and lymphoid follicles (tertiary lymphoid tissue) are able to respond to antigenic stimuli releasing cytokines or producing antibodies (secretory IgA). Intestinal epithelial cells are in close cooperation with intraepithelial lymphocytes and possess Toll-like receptors on their surface and Nod-like receptors (NLRs) which sense pathogens or pathogen-associated molecular patterns. Intestinal microbiota, mainly composed of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, generates tolerogenic response acting on gut dendritic cells and inhibiting the T helper (h)-17 cell anti-inflammatory pathway. This is the case of Bacteroides fragilis which leads to the production of interleukin-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, from both T regulatory cells and lamina propria macrophages. Conversely, segmented filamentous bacteria rather induce Th17 cells, thus promoting intestinal inflammation. Intestinal microbiota and its toxic components have been shown to act on both Nod1 and Nod2 receptors and their defective signaling accounts for the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In IBD a loss of normal tolerance to intestinal microbiota seems to be the main trigger of mucosal damage. In addition, intestinal microbiota thanks to its regulatory function of gut immune response can prevent or retard neoplastic growth. In fact, chronic exposure to environmental microorganisms seems to be associated with low frequency of cancer risk. Major nutraceuticals or functional foods employed in the modulation of intestinal microbiota are represented by prebiotics, probiotics, polyunsaturated fatty acids, amino acids and polyphenols. The cellular and molecular effects performed by these natural products in terms of modulation of the intestinal microbiota and mostly attenuation of the inflammatory pathway are described. © 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.",83.0

As a part of the environment, the human gastrointestinal tract hosts more than 100 trillion bacteria making up the gut microbiota. The human host provides a nutrient-rich environment while the microbiota provides indispensable functions that humans cannot exert themselves. Shifts in the bacterial makeup of the human gut microbiota have been associated with disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), irritable bowel syndrome and obesity. However, since most bacteria inhabiting our gut are not cultivable to date, until recently little was known about their individual functions. Metagenomics, i.e. the analysis of the collective genomes present in a defined ecosystem, gives insight into these specific functions. The first extensive catalogue of the intestinal metagenome outnumbers the size of the human genome by a factor of 150. Recently, 3 distinct 'types' of gut composition within the human population have been highlighted. These so-called 'enterotypes' are characterized by the dominant genera (Bacteroides, Prevotella and Ruminococcus) and their co-occurring phylogenetic groups. In accordance with the previously described impact of nutritional behavior (diet, probiotics and prebiotics) on specific bacterial populations, an association has been observed between long-term dietary habits and enterotypes. This recent discovery, i.e. that belonging to one or the other enterotype might be modulated by the diet opens up new perspectives in the fields of IBD, nutrition and therapeutic strategies.

Recently, a family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPR) acting as Ffatransporters has been reported including GPR120, which is expressed by intestinal epithelial cells. The GPR120 has been reported to affect the expression of glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 as well as function as a control point for anti-inflammatory effects. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether 12 selected intestinal bacteria, representing the 4 major phyla present in the intestine, affect intestinal epithelial cell GPR120 and GLP-1 mRNA abundance. Supernatants of the 12 bacteria were added to differentiated Caco- 2 intestinal epithelial cells cultured on filter inserts in concentrations corresponding to a cell:bacteria ratio of 1:200. After 4 h of incubation, changes in cellular mRNA of GLP-1 and GPR120 by bacterial supernatant were examined using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. The abundance of GLP-1 mRNA decreased when cells were exposed to 4 of the 12 supernatants (P ≤ 0.05) compared with cells without bacteria added. Supernatants from 8 of the 12 bacteria analyzed increased the mRNA level of GPR120 (P ≤ 0.05) compared with cells without bacteria added. The alteration in cellular GPR120 mRNA was observed with bacteria categorized as either probiotics or bacteria capable of inducing an anti-inflammatory effect. The beneficial effect of these bacteria may very well be mediated by regulation of GPR120.

The digestive tract is full of bacteria and many of these, including probiotics, are necessary for optimal digestive function. During bacterial gastroenteritis, harmful bacteria invade the digestive tract causing unpleasant symptoms and upsetting the balance between good and bad bacteria. Supplemental probiotics can help restore this balance. Studies have demonstrated that probiotics can often help reduce the severity of symptoms such as diarrhea and may help accelerate recovery. Probiotics are therapeutic preparations of live microorganisms administered in sufficient dosage to be beneficial to health. The therapeutic effects of these microorganisms appear to be strain specific. Primal Defense®, a unique, probiotic, bacterial compound, contains probiotics that support gut flora balance, promote consistent bowel function, control stomach acid levels to quickly eliminate burning sensation in the stomach and maintain immune system response. The probiotics in Primal Defense® maximize the benefits of a healthy diet by supporting normal absorption and assimilation of nutrients in the gut. Nearly 75% of our immune defenses are located in the digestive tract, so maintaining a favorable bacterial balance in the intestines (ideally 80% good or neutral bacteria to 20% bad or harmful bacteria) is crucial to achieving and maintaining optimum health. © D.D.

""Generally recognized as safe"" lactic acid bacteria synthesize these antimicrobial bacteriocins as components of their natural defense system. These are extremely versatile agents as they could be used as spermicidal agents to not only prevent unwanted pregnancy but also to combat the growing prevalence of sexually transmitted microbial infections and viral diseases. Probiotic LAB have also been well documented as being effective in biotherapeutic applications against gastrointestinal pathogens, e.g. Clostridium, Helicobacter pylori, Salmonella, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, and rotaviruses. Therapeutic application of probiotic strains to protect against gastrointestinal infections may be of great importance for future medicinal use. Methods and Findings: Herein, we report studies carried out to comparatively investigate antimicrobial activity of native and recombinant pediocin CP2 against general human pathogens and opportunistic pathogens associated with BV, gastrointestinal infections and others. Further, we demonstrate the spermicidal activity of pediocins, on human sperm so that it could be considered as a potent spermicidal agent. Conclusions: Pediocins have the ability to target a relatively wide range of pathogenic bacteria which is an important advantage, especially to replace antibiotics with much safer therapeutics and to combat the ever growing problem of antibiotic resistance, when compared to other antibiotics. They have the potential to perform a very specific role like treatment of bacterial vaginosis, gut infections and peptic ulcers.

The study reported here aimed to determine whether there are correlations between gastrointestinal tract microbiota population structure and energy use in chickens. Efficiency in converting food into muscle mass has a significant impact on the intensive animal production industries, where feed represents the major portion of production costs. Despite extensive breeding and selection efforts, there are still large differences in the growth performance of animals fed identical diets and reared under the same conditions. Variability in growth performance presents management difficulties and causes economic loss. An understanding of possible microbiota drivers of these differences has potentially important benefits for industry. In this study, differences in cecal and jejunal microbiota between broiler chickens with extreme feed conversion capabilities were analysed in order to identify candidate bacteria that may influence growth performance. The jejunal microbiota was largely dominated by lactobacilli (over 99% of jejunal sequences) and showed no difference between the birds with high and low feed conversion ratios. The cecal microbial community displayed higher diversity, and 24 unclassified bacterial species were found to be significantly (<0.05) differentially abundant between high and low performing birds. Such differentially abundant bacteria represent target populations that could potentially be modified with prebiotics and probiotics in order to improve animal growth performance. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.",171.0

Eight of 21 representative DGGE bands were affiliated with unidentified or unclassified bacteria. Vibrio, Pseudoalteromonas and Shewanella were also found from the DGGE gel. Analysis of clone libraries revealed that all sequenced clones were grouped into either of the following phyla: Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Tenericutes, Bacteroidetes, Fusobacteria, Cyanobacteria and unidentified or unclassified bacteria. The phylotypes affiliated with Firmicutes were not found in DC library, yet DC had a little portion of Cyanobacteria which did not exist in both WC and HC library.

The effect of the probiotics Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-5, Lactobacillus casei subsp. casei LC-01 and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12 on the composition and metabolic activities of the intestinal microbiota in human subjects during antibiotic treatment has been analyzed. Subjects that were placed on antibiotic therapy (amoxiciline/clavulanic or levofloxacin) were randomly assigned to receive a multispecies probiotic fermented milk (n = 122) or a placebo fermented milk (n = 125). Stool samples were collected at different intervals during the intervention study and analysed for faecal microbiota enumeration, probiotic species detection, enzyme activities and short chain fatty acid (SCFA) concentrations. The most predominant microbiota groups were total anaerobes, bacteroides and total aerobes. Probiotic species in fecal samples were analyzed by real-time PCR and results indicated that prevalence of the probiotic species within the probiotic group was below 50 % during the intervention study. Enzyme activities and SCFA concentrations showed a large inter-individual variability over the time in the placebo and probiotic groups, except to β-galactosidase activity, which was the most abundant in both groups over the time. In conclusion, the combination of L. acidophilus LA-5, L. casei subsp. casei LC-01 and B. animalis subsp. lactis Bb-12 taken in daily doses of 109-1010 colony-forming units (CFU) does not significantly influence (P &gt; 0. 05) either the fecal microbiota or its metabolic activity in elderly hospitalized patients taking amoxicillin/clavulanate or levofloxacin.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of eight synbiotic combinations on the composition and activity of human fecal microbiota using a four-stage semicontinuous model system of the human colon. Methods and Findings: Carbohydrates were selected by their ability to enhance growth of the probiotic bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM (NCFM) and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis Bl-04 (Bl-04) under laboratory conditions. The most effective carbohydrates for each probiotic were further investigated, using the colonic model, for the ability to support growth of the probiotic bacteria, influence the composition of the microbiota and stimulate formation of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA).The following combinations were studied: NCFM with isomaltulose, cellobiose, raffinose and an oat β-glucan hydrolysate (OBGH) and Bl-04 with melibiose, xylobiose, raffinose and maltotriose. All carbohydrates showed capable of increasing levels of NCFM and Bl-04 during fermentations in the colonic model by 103-104 fold and 10-102 fold, respectively. Also the synbiotic combinations decreased the modified ratio of Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes (calculated using qPCR results for Bacteroides-Prevotella-Porphyromonas group, Clostridium perfringens cluster I, Clostridium coccoides - Eubacterium rectale group and Clostridial cluster XIV) as well as significantly increasing SCFA levels, especially acetic and butyric acid, by three to eight fold, as compared to the controls. The decreases in the modified ratio of Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes were found to be correlated to increases in acetic and butyric acid (p = 0.04 and p = 0.03, respectively). Conclusions: The results of this study show that all synbiotic combinations investigated are able to shift the predominant bacteria and the production of SCFA of fecal microbiota in a model system of the human colon, thereby potentially being able to manipulate the microbiota in a way connected to human health. © 2012 van Zanten et al.",73.0

Design: Dams had free access to drinking water supplemented with Bifidobacterium animalis subsp lactis BB-12® (3×109 CFU/mL) and Propionibacterium jensenii 702 (8.0×108 CFU/mL) from 10 days before conception until postnatal day (PND) 22 (weaning day), or to control ad lib water. Offspring were subjected to MS from PND 2 to 14 or left undisturbed. From PND 83 to 85, animals underwent 30 min/day AS, or were left undisturbed as controls. On PND 24 and 86, blood samples were collected for corticosterone, ACTH and IgA measurement. Colonic contents were analysed for the composition of microflora and luminal IgA levels. Results: Exposure to MS significantly increased ACTH levels and neonatal fecal counts of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, E. coli, enterococci and clostridia, but reduced plasma IgA levels compared with non-MS animals. Animals exposed to AS exhibited significantly increased ACTH and corticosterone levels, decreased aerobic bacteria and bifidobacteria, and increased Bacteroides and E. coli counts compared to non-AS animals. MS coupled with AS induced significantly decreased anaerobes and clostridia compared with the non-stress adult controls. Maternal probiotic intervention significantly increased neonatal corticosterone levels which persisted until at least week 12 in females only, and also resulted in elevated adult ACTH levels and altered neonatal microflora comparable to that of MS. However, it improved plasma IgA responses, increased enterococci and clostridia in MS adults, increased luminal IgA levels, and restored anaerobes, bifidobacteria and E. coli to normal in adults. Conclusion: Maternal probiotic intervention induced activation of neonatal stress pathways and an imbalance in gut microflora. Importantly however, it improved the immune environment of stressed animals and protected, in part, against stress-induced disturbances in adult gut microflora. © 2012 Barouei et al.",70.0

Fecal microbiota therapy (FMT) is an emerging treatment for several gastrointestinal and metabolic disorders. It has demonstrated efficacy in treating refractory Clostridium difficile infection, and there are case reports of FMT successfully treating UC.

Methods: We conducted a single-center prospective pilot study. Thirty-six VLBW infants were randomly divided into two groups: group E, wherein B. bifidum was supplemented within 48 h of birth, and group L, wherein it was supplemented more than 48 h after birth. Results: Group E and group L reached a total feeding volume of 100 mL/(kg/day) after 10 [7-13] days and 11 [10-15] days, respectively (median [quartile]). The daily bodyweight gain in group E was significantly higher (21.4 ± 3.2 g/day vs 18.3 ± 4.0 g/day, P < 0.02; 11.1 ± 1.5 g/kg/day vs 10.4 ± 1.2 g/kg/day, P < 0.04). No significant differences were found in the fecal Bifidobacterium level between the groups quantitated with a real-time polymerase chain reaction assay at 1 and 4 weeks of age. However, the highest colonization rate of Bifidobacterium was observed when the supplementation started between 24 and 48 h after birth. The incidence of morbidities between the groups was similar. Conclusion: The early administration of B. bifidum to VLBW infants seems effective in promoting growth during the stay in the neonatal intensive care unit without increasing the incidence of morbidity. Furthermore, the preferable timing of starting the probiotic supplementation for VLBW infants is at latest less than 48 h after birth. © 2012 The Authors.

BACKGROUND:: The gut microbiota plays an essential role in human health. Toward seniority, its balance is affected by deep physiological changes. Long-lived people (age >90 y) have unusual features that differ from the younger elderly, so they should be considered separately when analyzing age-related features. However, they have been included in few studies and they have usually been grouped together with the younger elderly. STUDY:: The gut microbiota of 14 centenarians and 10 younger adults was analyzed. Cultivable bacteria belonging to the following groups were enumerated: enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcus, Staphylococcus, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, Bacteroides, and yeast. Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria were further characterized at the species level by pyrosequencing. RESULTS:: In centenarians, we observed a reduction in the quantity of enterobacteriaceae, bifidobacteria, and bacteroides and an increase in clostridia sensu stricto (P<0.05). The number of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species isolated in centenarians and younger adults was similar. The composition of the Lactobacillus subpopulation was quite different between the groups. The presence of Bifidobacterium longum in the gut seems to be a particular feature in centenarians. It is interesting to note that only 1 strain of B. longum was isolated from each centenarian subject. CONCLUSIONS:: The gut microbiota of centenarians has particular features that differ from both younger adults and the younger elderly. Further studies would help to understand whether the intestinal microbiota can influence life expectancy and whether the administration of probiotic bacteria could help to extend the longevity of human life. © 2012 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",62.0

The great advantage of therapy with probiotics is that they have few side effects such as selection of resistant bacteria or disturbance of the intestinal microbiota, which occur when antibiotics are used. Adhesion of pathogenic bacteria onto the surface of probiotics instead of onto intestinal receptors could explain part of the probiotic effect. Thus, this study evaluated the adhesion of pathogenic bacteria onto the cell wall of Saccharomyces boulardii and Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains UFMG 905, W303 and BY4741. To understand the mechanism of adhesion of pathogens to yeast, cell-wall mutants of the parental strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae BY4741 were used because of the difficulty of mutating polyploid yeast, as is the case for Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Saccharomyces boulardii. The tests of adhesion showed that, among 11 enteropathogenic bacteria tested, only Escherichia coli, Salmonella Typhimurium and Salmonella Typhi adhered to the surface of Saccharomyces boulardii, Saccharomyces cerevisiae UFMG 905 and Saccharomyces cerevisiae BY4741. The presence of mannose, and to some extent bile salts, inhibited this adhesion, which was not dependent on yeast viability. Among 44 cell-wall mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae BY4741, five lost the ability to fix the bacteria. Electron microscopy showed that the phenomenon of yeast-bacteria adhesion occurred both in vitro and in vivo (in the digestive tract of dixenic mice). In conclusion, some pathogenic bacteria were captured on the surface of Saccharomyces boulardii, Saccharomyces cerevisiae UFMG 905 and Saccharomyces cerevisiae BY4741, thus preventing their adhesion to specific receptors on the intestinal epithelium and their subsequent invasion of the host. © 2012 SGM Printed in Great Britain.",72.0

A randomized controlled trial in subjects with irritable bowel syndrome",2012,Gastroenterology Research and Practice,10.1155/2012/214102,"Introduction. Knowledge of the mechanism of action of probiotics in subjects with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is imperfect. Objective. This trial aimed at discriminating between a direct effect on the gut wall and an indirect effect caused by modulation of the fecal microbiota. Design. Randomized, double-blind, crossover trial. Material and Methods. Patients with IBS were given one capsule of 10 10 CFU L. plantarum MF1298 or placebo once daily. Symptoms were registered (score 015) and feces collected at the end of each period. The gut microbiota was analyzed with 16S rRNA gene analyses and results reported as proportions of Bacteroides, Faecalibacterium, and Lachnospiraceae and Simpsons D diversity score. Results. Sixteen participants (11 women) with a mean age of 50 years (SD 11) were available for the analyses. Intake of L. plantarum MF 1298 was associated with a significant aggravation of symptoms, but neither intake of L. plantarum MF 1298 nor symptoms were associated with the composition of the fecal microbiota (P values 0.10). Conclusions. The trial indicates that the symptomatic aggravation related to intake of L. plantarum MF 1298 was a direct effect of the microbe on the gut wall and not caused by changes in the fecal microbiota.

We evaluated the effects of Lactobacillus brevis KB290 (KB290), which has been demonstrated to be effective at improving bowel movements and the composition of intestinal microflora, on IBS symptoms.Methods: We performed a placebo control double-blind cross matched trial. Thirty-five males and females (aged 6 years and above) who had been diagnosed with IBS according to the Rome III criteria were divided into 2 groups, and after a 4-week pre-trial observation period, they were administered test capsules containing KB290 or placebo for 4 weeks (consumption period I). Then, the capsule administration was suspended for 4 weeks in both groups (washout period), before the opposite capsules were administered for a further 4 weeks (consumption period II). Fecal samples were collected on the first day of the pre-consumption observation period, the last day of consumption period I, the last day of the washout period, and the last day of consumption period II. In addition, the subjects' IBS symptoms and quality of life (QOL) and any adverse events that they experienced were evaluated.Results: No significant difference in IBS symptoms was noted among the various periods. However, the mean QOL scores were improved during the test capsule consumption.The frequencies of watery and mushy feces were significantly lower in the test capsule consumption period than during the pre-consumption observation period, and the frequency of abdominal pain was significantly reduced in the test capsule consumption period compared with the other periods.The frequency of the genus Bifidobacterium was significantly higher, and that of the genus Clostridium was significantly lower, after the test capsule consumption than after the placebo consumption. The frequencies of the genera Lactobacillus, Bacteroides, and Enterococcus were also investigated, but no differences in their frequencies were detected between the placebo and test capsule consumption periods.Conclusions: Probiotics, the safety of which has been established, are used widely in various foods and can now be purchased readily. The results of the present study suggest that KB290 is useful for early intervention in IBS. © 2012 Murakami et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",32.0

This study explored the potential of cell-free supernatants (CFS) from 2 probiotic Lactobacillus sp., Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, to inhibit colon cancer cell invasion by influencing matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) activity and levels of the tight junction protein zona occludens-1 (ZO-1) in cultured metastatic human colorectal carcinoma cells. HCT-116 cells were treated with CFS from L. casei, L. rhamnosus, or Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (a gut commensal); or with uninoculated bacterial growth media. Treatment with CFS from both Lactobacillus sp. decreased colorectal cell invasion but treatment with CFS from B. thetaiotaomicron did not. CFS from both Lactobacillus sp. decreased MMP-9 and increased ZO-1 protein levels. L. rhamnosus CFS also lowered MMP-9 activity. To begin elucidating the secreted bacterial factor conveying these responses, Lactobacillus sp. CFS were fractionated into defined molecular weight ranges and cell invasion assessed. Fractionation revealed that the inhibitory activity was contained primarily in the >100kDa and 50-100kDa fractions, suggesting the inhibitory compound may be a macromolecule such as a protein, nucleic acid, or a polysaccharide. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",88.0

Design: The inhibitory activity of S. salivarius K12 against Solobacterium moorei CCUG39336, four clinical S. moorei isolates, Atopobium parvulum ATCC33793 and Eubacterium sulci ATCC35585 was examined by a deferred antagonism test. Eubacterium saburreum ATCC33271 and Parvimonas micra ATCC33270, which have been tested in previous studies, served as positive controls, and the Gram-negative strain Bacteroides fragilis ZIB2800 served as a negative control. Additionally, the occurrence of resistance in S. moorei CCUG39336 to S. salivarius K12 was analysed by either direct plating or by passage of S. moorei CCUG39336 on chloroform-inactived S. salivarius K12-containing agar plates. Results: S. salivarius K12 suppressed the growth of all Gram-positive bacteria tested, but the extent to which the bacteria were inhibited varied. E. sulci ATCC35585 was the most sensitive strain, while all five S. moorei isolates were inhibited to a lesser extent. Natural resistance seems to be very low in S. moorei CCUG39336, and there was only a slight decrease in sensitivity after exposure to S. salivarius K12 over 10 passages. Conclusion: Our studies demonstrate that S. salivarius K12 has antimicrobial activity against bacteria involved in halitosis.

In this study, weanling piglets were orally administered low- or high-dose Lactobacillus rhamnosus ACTT 7469 (1010 CFU/d or 1012 CFU/d) for 1 week before F4 (K88)-positive Escherichia coli challenge. The compositions of faecal and gastrointestinal microbiota were recorded; gene expression in the intestines was assessed by real-time PCR; serum tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) concentrations and intestinal Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) were detected by ELISA and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Unexpectedly, high-dose administration increased the incidence of diarrhoea before F4+ETEC challenge, despite the fact that both doses ameliorated F4+ETEC-induced diarrhoea with increased Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium counts accompanied by reduced coliform shedding in faeces. Interestingly, L. rhamnosus administration reduced Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium counts in the colonic contents, and the high-dose piglets also had lower Lactobacillius and Bacteroides counts in the ileal contents. An increase in the concentration of serum TNF-α induced by F4+ETEC was observed, but the increase was delayed by L. rhamnosus. In piglets exposed to F4+ETEC, jejunal TLR4 expression increased at the mRNA and protein levels, while jejunal interleukin (IL)-8 and ileal porcine β-defensins 2 (pBD2) mRNA expression increased; however, these increases were attenuated by administration of L. rhamnosus. Notably, expression of jejunal TLR2, ileal TLR9, Nod-like receptor NOD1 and TNF-α mRNA was upregulated in the low-dose piglets after F4+ETEC challenge, but not in the high-dose piglets. These findings indicate that pretreatment with a low dose of L. rhamnosus might be more effective than a high dose at ameliorating diarrhoea. There is a risk that high-dose L. rhamnosus pretreatment may negate the preventative effects, thus decreasing the prophylactic benefits against potential enteric pathogens. Our data suggest a safe threshold for preventative use of probiotics in clinical practice. © 2012 Li et al.",96.0

Herein, the effects of Bacteroides uniformis CECT 7771 on obesity-related metabolic and immune alterations have been evaluated. Methods and Findings: Adult (6-8 week) male wild-type C57BL-6 mice were fed a standard diet or a high-fat-diet HFD to induce obesity, supplemented or not with B. uniformis CECT 7771 for seven weeks. Animal weight was monitored and histologic, biochemical, immunocompetent cell functions, and features of the faecal microbiota were analysed after intervention. The oral administration of B. uniformis CECT 7771 reduced body weight gain, liver steatosis and liver cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations and increased small adipocyte numbers in HFD-fed mice. The strain also reduced serum cholesterol, triglyceride, glucose, insulin and leptin levels, and improved oral tolerance to glucose in HFD fed mice. The bacterial strain also reduced dietary fat absorption, as indicated by the reduced number of fat micelles detected in enterocytes. Moreover, B. uniformis CECT 7771 improved immune defence mechanisms, impaired in obesity. HFD-induced obesity led to a decrease in TNF-α production by peritoneal macrophages stimulated with LPS, conversely, the administration of B. uniformis CECT 7771 increased TNF-α production and phagocytosis. Administering this strain also increased TNF-α production by dendritic cells (DCs) in response to LPS stimulation, which was significantly reduced by HFD. B. uniformis CECT 7771 also restored the capacity of DCs to induce a T-cell proliferation response, which was impaired in obese mice. HFD induced marked changes in gut microbiota composition, which were partially restored by the intervention. Conclusions: Altogether, the findings indicate that administration of B. uniformis CECT 7771 ameliorates HFD-induced metabolic and immune dysfunction associated with intestinal dysbiosis in obese mice. © 2012 Gauffin Cano et al.",214.0

In order to confirm the tolerance of healthy humans to a regular oral intake of the strain B. xylanisolvens DSM 23964, we here report on the safety data of two successive human studies: a randomised and double-blind parallel group-controlled pilot study with 41 volunteers receiving a daily dose of a pasteurised fermented milk product containing up to 8.5×1011 B. xylanisolvens DSM 23964 cells for 3 weeks, and a randomised and placebo-controlled double-blind major study with 140 volunteers receiving the same product but spray-dried and containing up to 1012 cells for 6 weeks. In both studies no persistent side effects of any kind were reported. The measured haematological parameters, and the serum concentrations of immunoglobulin and of inflammatory markers (IL-6, CRP, IFN-γ) were unaffected by the supplementation in both studies. A small decrease in the phagocytic activity of granulocytes and a small increase of TNF-α detected in the pilot study were both invalidated by the major study.

Here we begin to explore the pilot hypothesis that specific microbial populations may contribute to HNSCC pathogenesis via epigenetic modifications in inflammatory- and HNSCC-associated genes. Microbiomic profiling by 16S rRNA sequencing of matched tumor and adjacent normal tissue specimens in 42 individuals with HNSCC demonstrate a significant association of specific bacterial subpopulations with HNSCC over normal tissue (P < 0.01). Furthermore, microbial populations can separate tumors by tobacco status (P < 0.008), but not by alcohol status (P 5 0.41). If our subhypothesis regarding a mechanistic link from microorganism to carcinogenesis via inflammation and consequent aberrant DNA methylation is correct, then we should see hypermethylation of relevant genes associate with specific microbiomic profiles. Methylation analysis in four genes (MDR1, IL8, RARB, TGFBR2) previously linked to HNSCC or inflammation shows significantly increased methylation in tumor samples compared with normal oral mucosa. Of these, MDR1 promoter methylation associates with specific microbiomic profiles in tumor over normal mucosa. Additionally, we report that MDR1 methylation correlates with regional nodal metastases in the context of two specific bacterial subpopulations, Enterobacteriaceae and Tenericutes (P < 0.001 for each). These associations may lead to a different, and potentially more comprehensive, perspective on the pathogenesis of HNSCC, and support further exploration of mechanistic linkage and, if so, novel therapeutic strategies such as demethylating agents and probiotic adjuncts, particularly for patients with advanced or refractory disease. © The Author 2011.

We demonstrated that the IBS microbiota is different from that of healthy individuals due to an unbalance in a number of commensal species, with an increase in relative abundance of lactobacilli, B. cereus and B. clausii, bifidobacteria, Clostridium cluster IX and E. rectale, and a decrease in abundance of Bacteroides/Prevotella group and Veillonella genus. Additionally, we demonstrated that some bacterial groups of the human intestinal microbiota, recently defined as pathobionts, are increased in concentration in the IBS microbiota. Furthermore, we aimed at investigating if the daily administration of a novel probiotic yoghurt containing B. animalis subsp lactis Bb12 and K. marxianus B0399, recently demonstrated to have beneficial effects in the management of IBS symptoms, could impact on the biostructure of IBS microbiota, modulating its composition to counteract putative dysbiosis found in IBS subjects. Notably, we demonstrated that the beneficial effects associated to the probiotic preparation are not related to significant modifications in the composition of the human intestinal microbiota. © 2012 Landes Bioscience.",27.0
"Simrén M., Doré J.",Gut microbiota for health-current insights and understanding,2012,European Gastroenterology and Hepatology Review,,"Study of the gut microbiota is a burgeoning area of research, yielding findings with the potential to inform, direct and identify new opportunities for medical and dietary interventions with potential to impact positively on human health and disease. The gut microbiota plays a key role in immune function and in normal digestion and metabolism. Alteration or instability of the gut microbiota and changes in its biodiversity are associated not only with gastrointestinal disorders and metabolic diseases but also with far reaching consequences on host health. This paper provides a summary of a meeting that brought together scientists and clinicians involved in unravelling the complex host-microbiota relationship, and offers insights into the ways in which the latest scientific and clinical research on gut microbiota is finding practical applications. © TOUCH BRIEFINGS 2012.",3.0

While there has been an effort to document the microbiome of the CF lung in pediatric and adult patients, little is known regarding the developing microflora in infants. We examined the respiratory and intestinal microbiota development in infants with CF from birth to 21 months. Distinct genera dominated in the gut compared to those in the respiratory tract, yet some bacteria overlapped, demonstrating a core microbiota dominated by Veillonella and Streptococcus. Bacterial diversity increased significantly over time, with evidence of more rapidly acquired diversity in the respiratory tract. There was a high degree of concordance between the bacteria that were increasing or decreasing over time in both compartments; in particular, a significant proportion (14/16 genera) increasing in the gut were also increasing in the respiratory tract. For 7 genera, gut colonization presages their appearance in the respiratory tract. Clustering analysis of respiratory samples indicated profiles of bacteria associated with breast-feeding, and for gut samples, introduction of solid foods even after adjustment for the time at which the sample was collected. Furthermore, changes in diet also result in altered respiratory microflora, suggesting a link between nutrition and development of microbial communities in the respiratory tract. Our findings suggest that nutritional factors and gut colonization patterns are determinants of the microbial development of respiratory tract microbiota in infants with CF and present opportunities for early intervention in CF with altered dietary or probiotic strategies. IMPORTANCE While efforts have been focused on assessing the microbiome of pediatric and adult cystic fibrosis (CF) patients to understand how chronic colonization by these microbes contributes to pulmonary damage, little is known regarding the earliest development of respiratory and gut microflora in infants with CF. Our findings suggest that colonization of the respiratory tract by microbes is presaged by colonization of the gut and demonstrated a role of nutrition in development of the respiratory microflora. Thus, targeted dietary or probiotic strategies may be an effective means to change the course of the colonization of the CF lung and thereby improve patient outcomes. © 2012 Madan et al.",217.0

The advent of powerful, cultivation-free molecular methods makes it possible to characterize the total microbiome down to the genus level in large cohorts. Objective: We sought to assess microbial diversity and characterize the dominant bacteria in stool during the first year of life in relation to atopic eczema development. Methods: Microbial diversity and composition were analyzed with barcoded 16S rDNA 454-pyrosequencing in stool samples at 1 week, 1 month, and 12 months of age in 20 infants with IgE-associated eczema and 20 infants without any allergic manifestation until 2 years of age (ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT01285830). Results: Infants with IgE-associated eczema had a lower diversity of the total microbiota at 1 month (P =.004) and a lower diversity of the bacterial phylum Bacteroidetes and the genus Bacteroides at 1 month (P =.02 and P =.01) and the phylum Proteobacteria at 12 months of age (P =.02). The microbiota was less uniform at 1 month than at 12 months of age, with a high interindividual variability. At 12 months, when the microbiota had stabilized, Proteobacteria, comprising gram-negative organisms, were more abundant in infants without allergic manifestation (Empirical Analysis of Digital Gene Expression in R [edgeR] test: P =.008, q = 0.02). Conclusion: Low intestinal microbial diversity during the first month of life was associated with subsequent atopic eczema. © 2012 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.",514.0

We here present the preliminary safety evaluation of a new Bacteroides xylanisolvens strain (DSM 23964) isolated from human feces. First results suggest that it may be able to provide probiotic health benefits. Its identity was confirmed by biochemical analysis, by sequencing of its 16S rRNA genes, and by DNA-DNA hybridization. Virulence determinants known to occur in the genus Bacteroides, such the bft enterotoxin and other enzymatic activities involved in the degradation of the extracellular matrix and the capsular polysaccharide PS A, were absent in this strain. The investigation of the antibiotic susceptibility indicated that strain DSM 23964 was sensitive to metronidazole, meropenem agents, and clindamycin. Resistance to penicillin and ampicillin was identified to be conferred by the β-lactamase cepA gene and could therefore be restored by adding β-lactamase inhibitors. The localization of the cepA gene in the genome of strain DSM 23964 and the absence of detectable plasmids further suggest that a transfer of β-lactamase activity or the acquisition of other antibiotic resistances are highly improbable. Taken together, the presented data indicate that the strain B. xylanisolvens DSM 23964 has no virulence potential. Since it also resists the action of gastric enzymes and low-pH conditions, this strain is an interesting candidate for further investigation of its safety and potential health-promoting properties. © 2012, American Society for Microbiology.",30.0

Methods and Results: Adult Swiss albino mice received Lact. fermentum CRL1446 at the doses 10 7 and 10 9 cells per day per mouse for 2, 5, 7 and 10days. Intestinal FE activity, intestinal microbiota counts, plasmatic thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) percentage and glutathione reductase (GR) activity were determined. Mice that received Lact. fermentum CRL1446 at the dose 10 7 cells per day for 7days showed a twofold increase in total intestinal FE activity, compared to the nontreated group. In large intestine content, FE activity increased up to 6·4 times. No major quantitative changes in colonic microbiota were observed in treated animals. Administration of this strain produced an approx. 30-40% decrease in the basal levels of plasmatic TBARS and an approx. twofold increase in GR activity from day 5 of feeding with both doses. Conclusions: Oral administration of Lact. fermentum CRL1446 to mice increases total intestinal FE activity, decreases the basal percentage of plasmatic lipoperoxides and increases GR activity. Significance and Impact of the Study: Lactobacillus fermentum CRL1446 could be orally administered as a dietary supplement or functional food for increasing the intestinal FE activity to enhance the bioavailability of ferulic acid, thus improving oxidative status. © 2011 The Authors.

"Compare D., Nardone G.",Contribution of gut microbiota to colonic and extracolonic cancer development,2011,Digestive Diseases,10.1159/000332967,"It is estimated that 20% of malignancies worldwide can be attributed to infections, i.e. about 1.2 million cases per year. A typical example of the association between bacterial infection and gastrointestinal malignancies is Helicobacter pylori infection with both gastric cancer and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. Bacteria are an important component of the human body. The human intestine contains >500 different types of microorganisms, the 'gut microbiota', that play important functions such as energetic metabolism, proliferation and survival of epithelial cells, and protection against pathogens. Chronic alteration of intestinal microbiota homeostasis, 'dysbiosis', could promote many diseases, including cancer. The mechanisms by which bacteria may induce carcinogenesis include chronic inflammation, immune evasion, and immune suppression. There are three effector pathways of T helper (Th) cell differentiation: Th1 responses promoted by procarcinogenic signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat)1 and Stat4 signaling, Th2 responses promoted by Stat6 signaling, and Th17 responses promoted by Stat3 signaling. Interestingly, Th1 responses, driven by IL-12 and characterized by IFN-γ production, are typically anticarcinogenic, whereas Th17 responses are activated in various cancers. Furthermore, a T regulatory response, driven by IL-10 and TGF-β, counterbalances the proinflammatory effect of Th17 responses. Elevated numbers of T regulatory cells suppress the innate and adaptive immune responses, thereby contributing to tumor progression. The emerging relationship between gut microbiota and cancer has prompted new ways of thinking about cancer prevention and has led to the development of noninvasive diagnostic tests and innovative treatments, such as with probiotics. However, although in vitro and animal model studies suggest a protective anticancer effect of probiotics, the results of human epidemiological studies are controversial. Copyright © 2011 S.

"Bezirtzoglou E., Stavropoulou E.",Immunology and probiotic impact of the newborn and young children intestinal microflora,2011,Anaerobe,10.1016/j.anaerobe.2011.03.010,"Human body has developed a holistic defence system, which mission is either to recognize and destroy the aggressive invaders or to evolve mechanisms permitting to minimize or restore the consequences of harmful actions. The host immune system keeps the capital role to preserve the microbial intestinal balance via the barrier effect. Specifically, pathogenic invaders such as, bacteria, parasites, viruses and other xenobiotic invaders are rejected out of the body via barriers formed by the skin, mucosa and intestinal flora. In case physical barriers are breached, the immune system with its many components comes into action in order to fence infection. The intestine itself is considered as an "" active organ"" due to its abundant bacterial flora and to its large metabolic activity. The variation among different species or even among different strains within a species reflects the complexity of the genetic polymorphism which regulates the immune system functions. Additionally factors such as, gender, particular habits, smoking, alcohol consumption, diet, religion, age, gender, precedent infections and vaccinations must be involved. Hormonal profile and stress seems to be associated to the integrity microbiota and inducing immune system alterations. Which bacterial species are needed for inducing a proper barrier effect is not known, but it is generally accepted that this barrier function can be strongly supported by providing benefic alimentary supplements called functional foods. In this vein it is stressed the fact that early intestinal colonization with organisms such as Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria and possibly subsequent protection from many different types of diseases. Moreover, this benefic microflora dominated but Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli support the concept of their ability to modify the gut microbiota by reducing the risk of cancer following their capacity to decrease β-glucoronidase and carcinogen levels. Because of their beneficial roles in the human gastrointestinal tract, LAB are referred to as "" probiotics"" , and efforts are underway to employ them in modern nutrition habits with so-called functional foods. Members of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium genera are normal residents of the microbiota in the human gastrointestinal tract, in which they developed soon after birth. But, whether such probiotic strains derived from the human gut should be commercially employed in the so-called functional foods is a matter of debate between scientists and the industrial world. Within a few hours from birth the newborn develops its normal bacterial flora. Indeed human milk frequently contains low amounts of non-pathogenic bacteria like Streptococcus, Micrococcus, Lactobacillus, Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium and Bifidobacterium. In general, bacteria start to appear in feces within a few hours after birth. Colonization by Bifidobacterium occurs generally within 4 days of life. Claims have been made for positive effects of Bifidobacterium on infant growth and health. The effect of certain bacteria having a benefic action on the intestinal ecosystem is largely discussed during the last years by many authors. Bifidobacterium is reported to be a probiotic bacterium, exercising a beneficial effect on the intestinal flora. An antagonism has been reported between B.bifidum and C.perfringens in the intestine of newborns delivered by cesarian section. The aim of the probiotic approach is to repair the deficiencies in the gut flora and restore the protective effect. However, the possible ways in which the gut microbiota is being influenced by probiotics is yet unknown. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",64.0

The aim of this study was to determine the ability of a defined Lactobacillus plantarum to prevent ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) induced intestinal infection. Methods: Female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly allocated into three groups: (1) controls (sham-operated, no treatment), (2) ischemia/reperfusion and (3) ischemia/reperfusion and Lactobacillus plantarum treatment. Lactobacillus plantarum L2 was administered daily intragastrically 14 days prior to induction of I/R. Rats were then sacrificed, and tissue and blood samples were cultured to determine bacterial translocation. Cytokines in plasma were detected by ELISA. Ileal segments were removed for morphological examination. Results: Intestinal I/R induced excess pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and barrier dysfunction (increased epithelial cell apoptosis, cecal flora dysbiosis, disruption of mucosa and multiple erosions) in the intestine, associated with increased bacterial translocation to extraintestinal sites. Approximately 87.5% of rats exposed to I/R had bacterial translocation while there was no bacterial translocation in controls. However, pretreatment of animals with Lactobacillus plantarum completely prevented I/R induced bacterial translocation, reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine release, and intestinal epithelial cell apoptosis, resulting in recovered microflora and mucosal integrity. Conclusions: These findings indicate that Lactobacillus plantarum L2 can prevent I/R-induced bacterial translocation and intestinal barrier dysfunction and, thereby, exert beneficial effects in the intestinal tract. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",24.0

However, the effects of prebiotics on the human gut microbiota are incomplete as most studies have relied on methods that fail to cover the breadth of the bacterial community. The goal of this research was to use high throughput multiplex community sequencing of 16S rDNA tags to gain a community wide perspective of the impact of prebiotic galactooligosaccharide (GOS) on the fecal microbiota of healthy human subjects. Fecal samples from eighteen healthy adults were previously obtained during a feeding trial in which each subject consumed a GOS-containing product for twelve weeks, with four increasing dosages (0, 2.5, 5, and 10 gram) of GOS. Multiplex sequencing of the 16S rDNA tags revealed that GOS induced significant compositional alterations in the fecal microbiota, principally by increasing the abundance of organisms within the Actinobacteria. Specifically, several distinct lineages of Bifidobacterium were enriched. Consumption of GOS led to five- to ten-fold increases in bifidobacteria in half of the subjects. Increases in Firmicutes were also observed, however, these changes were detectable in only a few individuals. The enrichment of bifidobacteria was generally at the expense of one group of bacteria, the Bacteroides. The responses to GOS and the magnitude of the response varied between individuals, were reversible, and were in accordance with dosage. The bifidobacteria were the only bacteria that were consistently and significantly enriched by GOS, although this substrate supported the growth of diverse colonic bacteria in mono-culture experiments. These results suggest that GOS can be used to enrich bifidobacteria in the human gastrointestinal tract with remarkable specificity, and that the bifidogenic properties of GOS that occur in vivo are caused by selective fermentation as well as by competitive interactions within the intestinal environment. © 2011 Davis et al.",211.0

A cross-sectional study was done by taking samples from female patients who had been treated for BV in a randomized controlled trial. A presumptive identification for Lactobacillus spp and BV associated bacteria was done on isolates from a pelvic inflammatory disease laboratory. Fifty organisms identified presumptively as Lactobacillus spp were removed from stock by culturing them in fresh Brucella agar (oxoid) media for characterization. The BV associated organisms were also removed from stock and cultured in fresh media and identified through various biochemical tests. The biochemical data, H202 production data and data on inhibitory potential of Lactobacillus was then carried out. Lactobacillus jensenii, L. salivarius, L. fermentum, L. paraplantanarum, L. crispatus, L. iners, L. casei, L. plantanarum, L. vaginalis, and L. acidophilus were isolated. L. jensenii and L. salivarius were the most predominant Lactobacillus species isolated. L. jensenii was significantly (p<0.5) more abundant than other lactobacillus species. 54% of lactobacilli inhibited G. vaginalis, 56% inhibited Mobiluncus spp and 26% inhibited P. bivia. None of the selected species of lactobacilli were found to be inhibitory to Bacteroides fragilis. It was concluded that H2O2 contributes to the inhibition of BV associated organisms and should be a factor to consider when characterizing Lactobacilli for probiotic use. Administration of preparations containing a well characterized probiotic strain to human could be used to prevent acquisition or cure both BV and gastrointestinal disorders.",

The homeostasis of the gut microbiota is dependent on host characteristics (age, gender, genetic background...), environmental conditions (stress, drugs, gastrointestinal surgery, infectious and toxic agents...). Moreover, it is dependent on the day-to-day dietary changes. Experimental data in animals, but also observational studies in obese patients, suggest that the composition of the gut microbiota is a factor characterizing obese versus lean individuals, diabetic versus non diabetic patients, or patients presenting hepatic diseases such as non alcoholic steatohepatitis. Interestingly, the changes in the gut microbes can be reversed by dieting and related weight loss. The qualitative and quantitative changes in the intake of specific food components (fatty acids, carbohydrates, micronutrients, prebiotics, probiotics), have not only consequences on the gut microbiota composition, but may modulate the expression of genes in host tissues such as the liver, adipose tissue, intestine, muscle. This in turn may drive or lessen the development of fat mass and metabolic disturbances associated with the gut barrier function and the systemic immunity. The relevance of the prebiotic or probiotic approaches in the management of obesity in humans is supported by few intervention studies in humans up to now, but the experimental data obtained with those compounds help to elucidate novel potential molecular targets relating diet with gut microbes. The metagenomic and integrative metabolomic approaches could help elucidate which bacteria, among the trillions in human gut, or more specifically which activities/genes, could participate to the control of host energy metabolism, and could be relevant for future therapeutic developments. © 2011 Delzenne et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",159.0

However, the changes in the gut flora during the early phase of a critical illness are unknown. Aims: We investigated the changes in the gut flora at an early phase of severe insult in critically ill patients. Methods: Fifteen patients who experienced a sudden and severe insult were studied, along with 12 healthy volunteers as the control group. Fecal samples were acquired from the subjects by swabs of the rectum within 6 h after admission to the emergency room (day 0). Samples were serially collected from patients until day 14. Samples were also collected from control subjects. Results: On day 0, total bacterial counts were decreased to one-thousandth the number of the control subjects, in particular, obligate anaerobes and Lactobacillus were significantly decreased.

However, evidence that led to this belief was based in part on non-physiological conditions, antioxidant-free aerobic conditions selected to maximize both production and microbicidal activity of H2O2. Here we used conditions more like those in vivo to compare the effects of physiologically plausible concentrations of H2O2and lactic acid on a broad range of BV-associated bacteria and vaginal lactobacilli.Methods: Anaerobic cultures of seventeen species of BV-associated bacteria and four species of vaginal lactobacilli were exposed to H2O2, lactic acid, or acetic acid at pH 7.0 and pH 4.5. After two hours, the remaining viable bacteria were enumerated by growth on agar media plates. The effect of vaginal fluid (VF) on the microbicidal activities of H2O2and lactic acid was also measured.Results: Physiological concentrations of H2O2(&lt; 100 μM) failed to inactivate any of the BV-associated bacteria tested, even in the presence of human myeloperoxidase (MPO) that increases the microbicidal activity of H2O2. At 10 mM, H2O2inactivated all four species of vaginal lactobacilli but only one of seventeen species of BV-associated bacteria. Moreover, the addition of just 1% vaginal fluid (VF) blocked the microbicidal activity of 1 M H2O2. In contrast, lactic acid at physiological concentrations (55-111 mM) and pH (4.5) inactivated all the BV-associated bacteria tested, and had no detectable effect on the vaginal lactobacilli. Also, the addition of 10% VF did not block the microbicidal activity of lactic acid.Conclusions: Under optimal, anaerobic growth conditions, physiological concentrations of lactic acid inactivated BV-associated bacteria without affecting vaginal lactobacilli, whereas physiological concentrations of H2O2produced no detectable inactivation of either BV-associated bacteria or vaginal lactobacilli. Moreover, at very high concentrations, H2O2was more toxic to vaginal lactobacilli than to BV-associated bacteria. On the basis of these in vitro observations, we conclude that lactic acid, not H2O2, is likely to suppress BV-associated bacteria in vivo. © 2011 O'Hanlon et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",196.0

The aim of the present study was to compare and contrast the early innate immune response of pediatric ""healthy"" versus CD mucosa to pathogenic, probiotic, and commensal bacteria. Methods: ""Healthy control"" and CD pediatric mucosal biopsies (terminal ileum and transverse colon) were cocultured for 8 hours with E. coli O42, Lactobacillus GG (LGG), Bacteroidesthetaiotaomicron (B. theta), or stimulated with interleukin (IL)-1β (positive control). Matched nonstimulated biopsies served as experimental controls. IL-8 was the immune marker of choice. IL-8 mRNA and protein levels were quantified by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. Results: IL-8 secretion was observed when control, ileal biopsies were exposed to pathogenic O42 and probiotic LGG, with no response noted to commensal B. theta. In comparison, Crohn's ileal biopsies showed impaired ability to induce IL-8 in response to O42 and LGG. Control colonic tissue showed a limited response to O42 or B. theta and LGG significantly reduced IL-8 secretion. Unlike control tissue, however, Crohn's ileal and colonic tissue did respond to B. theta, with more enhanced expression in the colon. Conclusions: We provide the first ex vivo data to support the notion that aberrant mucosal recognition of commensal bacteria may contribute to pediatric CD. While IL-8 responses to O42 and LGG varied with disease status and anatomical location, B. theta consistently induced significant IL-8 both in ileal and colonic CD tissue, which was not seen in control, healthy tissue.

Despite the vast level of consumption of S. thermophilus through yogurt or probiotic functional food, very few data are available about its physiology in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). The objective of the present work was to explore both the metabolic activity and host response of S. thermophilus in vivo. Our study profiles the protein expression of S. thermophilus after its adaptation to the GIT of gnotobiotic rats and describes the impact of S. thermophilus colonization on the colonic epithelium. S. thermophilus colonized progressively the GIT of germ-free rats to reach a stable population in 30 days (108 cfu/g of feces). This progressive colonization suggested that S. thermophilus undergoes an adaptation process within GIT. Indeed, we showed that the main response of S. thermophilus in the rat's GIT was the massive induction of the glycolysis pathway, leading to formation of lactate in the cecum. At the level of the colonic epithelium, the abundance of monocarboxylic acid transporter mRNAs (SLC16A1 and SLC5A8) and a protein involved in the cell cycle arrest (p27 kip1) increased in the presence of S. thermophilus compared with germ-free rats. Based on different mono-associated rats harboring two different strains of S. thermophilus (LMD-9 or LMG18311) or weak lactate-producing commensal bacteria (Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Ruminococcus gnavus), we propose that lactate could be a signal produced by S. thermophilus and modulating the colon epithelium. © 2011 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",38.0

Materials and Methods: Piglets (n = 36) were randomized 12 hours after birth to receive total enteral nutrition (TEN) as formula; TEN + GOS (4 g/L), TEN + PDX (4 g/L), or TEN + GOS + PDX (2 g/L each) for 7 days or were supported by total parenteral nutrition (TPN) as a positive control for BT (n = 8). Blood, spleen, liver, and mesenteric lymph node (MLN) samples were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Colon microbiota 16S rDNA was measured by polymerase chain reaction. Myeloperoxidase activity and tumor necrosis factor-α expression were measured in ileum and ascending colon. Results: Among the enterally fed groups, no difference was seen in the Lactobacillus and Bacteroides 16S rDNA copies per gram of colonic contents, yet total bacterial levels were lower (P < 0.05) in the TEN + GOS group compared with TEN alone. Bacteria were detected in the blood, liver spleen, and MLN of TPN piglets. In contrast, bacterial counts were predominantly detected in the MLN of TEN piglets, at much lower levels than in TPN, and levels were not affected by GOS and PDX addition. TPN piglets had elevated (P < 0.05) ileal myeloperoxidase activity and a trend in elevated ascending colon tumor necrosis factor-α expression (P = 0.1). Conclusions: PDX and GOS added to formula do not induce BT in healthy piglets. Low levels of bacteria in MLN of healthy neonatal piglets may reflect mucosal sampling rather than pathological BT.

Obesity arises when these two factors are out of balance. Recently, the microflora residing in the human gut has been found to be one of the influential factors disturbing energy balance. Recent interest in this field has led to use of the term ""gut microbiome"" to describe the genomes of trillions of microbes residing in the gut. Metagenomic studies have shown that the human gut microbiome facilitates fermentation of indigestible carbohydrates to short-chain fatty acids that provide excess energy to the body, thus contributing to the obese phenotype. Alteration in the ratio of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes drives a change in fermentation patterns that could explain weight gain. Therefore, changes in the gut microbiome (induced by antibiotics or dietary supplements) may be helpful in curbing the obesity pandemic.

The membranous fraction of P. distasonis (mPd) prevented DSS-induced increases in several proinflammatory cytokines, increased mPd-specific serum antibodies and stabilized the intestinal microbial ecology. The anti-colitic effect of oral mPd was not observed in severe combined immunodeficient mice and probably involved induction of specific antibody responses and stabilization of the intestinal microbiota.

Delicate balance of numerous bacterial species can affect development of the immune system, how susceptible a host is to pathogenic organisms, and the auto-inflammatory state of the host. In the last decade, with the increased use of germ-free mice, gnotobiotic mice, and animal models in which a germ-free animal has been colonized with a foreign microbiota such as humanized mice, it has been possible to delineate relationships that specific bacteria have with the host immune system and to show what role they may play in overall host health. These models have not only allowed us to tease out the roles of individual species, but have also allowed the discovery and characterization of functionally unknown organisms. For example, segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB) have been shown to play a vital role in expansion of IL-17 producing cells. Prior to linking their key role in immune system development, little was known about these organisms. Bacteroides fragilis can rescue some of the immune defects of gnotobiotic mice after mono-colonization and have anti-inflammatory properties that can alleviate colitis and experimental allergic encephalitis in murine models. Additionally, Clostridium species have most recently been shown to expand regulatoryT-cell populations leading to anti-inflammatory conditions. This review will highlight and summarize some of the major findings within the last decade concerning the role of select groups of bacteria including SFB, Clostridium, Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, and Lactobacillus, and their impact on host mucosal immune systems. © 2011 Reading and Kasper.",58.0

However, also molecules produced by both probiotic and non-probiotic bacteria and administered alone seem to provide beneficial effects similar to those obtained with live cells. These molecules can stimulate different signalling pathways by activating pattern recognition receptors and modulate different immune responses in the host. This review focuses on bacterial components, such as surface molecules and DNA, with beneficial immunomodula-tory properties. Lipopolysaccharides from Gram-negative bacteria, lipoteichoic acid from Gram-positive bacteria and DNA of specific strains are the most effective molecules in modulating the host immune response, as they can modify the pattern of released cytokines. Bacterial components with beneficial properties could be an interesting substitute to traditional probiotics, as they could eliminate some of the risks associated with the consumption of live bacteria. Data presented in this review show that the concept of probiotic agent should change, as a large portion of the beneficial effects of probiotic bacteria does not depend on their viability and integrity. A more clear understanding of molecular mechanisms resulting in the health benefits provided by probiotics could be the basis for a more rational application of probiotics in functional foods or as supporting therapy for specific disorders. © 2011 Bentham Science Publishers.",

Twelve scissor probes covering major rumen bacterial groups were used, detecting c. 60-90% of the total 16S rRNAs. At 1 week of age, 16S rRNAs from members of the Bacteroides-Prevotella group (40.0% of the total 16S rRNAs), Faecalibacterium (21.7%), the Clostridium coccoides-Eubacterium rectale group (16.7%) and the Atopobium cluster (10.9%) were detected at high levels. Throughout the 12-week period, rRNAs of the Bacteroides-Prevotella and the Cl. coccoides-Eu. rectale groups constituted the major fraction of microbiota (c. 50-70% of the total). The relative abundances of the Atopobium cluster, Faecalibacterium, and some probiotic bacteria (such as those of the genera Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium) decreased as the animal aged. Instead, an uncultivated rumen bacterial group, as well as Ruminococcus flavefaciens and Fibrobacter emerged at the detectable levels (1-2%) in the faeces sampled at a postweaning age. In addition, certain bacterial groups that were not covered by the probe suite increased as the animals aged.Conclusions: Young calves undergo dynamic changes in their intestinal bacterial community during the first 12 weeks of life. As young ruminants undergo metabolic and physiological development in their digestive tracts in the transition from a monogastric to a ruminant animal at an early age, the intestinal bacterial community may reflect such development.Significance and Impact of the Study: The succession of the bacterial communities in the faeces of calves was quantitatively monitored in the present study for the first time.

Thus, there is an increasing interest in the addition of probiotics to infant formulas. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety of a follow-on formula with Lactobacillus salivarius CECT5713 in 6-mo-old children. Methods: The antibiotic susceptibility of L. salivarius CECT5713 was analyzed by a dilution method. A double-blinded, randomized, placebo controlled study was performed. Children (n = 80) were distributed in two groups and consumed the formula supplemented or not with probiotics (2 × 106 colony-forming units [cfu]/g) during 6 mo. Fecal samples were collected at enrollment, at 3 mo, and at the end of trial. Clinical and anthropometric evaluations were performed. Depending on the variable, one-way or two-way repeated measures analysis of variance were used for the statistical analysis. Results: The antibiotic susceptibility profile of the strain resulted as safe. No adverse effects associated with the consumption of the probiotic formula were reported. In addition, clinical parameters did not differ between groups. Consumption of the probiotic supplemented formula led to an increase in the fecal lactobacilli content (7.6 ± 0.2 versus 7.9 ± 0.1 log cfu/g, P &lt; 0.05).

Celiac disease is an autoimmune enteropathy caused by gliadins, and has been associated with a reduced proportion of Bifidobacterium in gut microbiota. This study evaluates the influence of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) on bacterial adhesion and their contribution in the gliadins-induced inflammatory response. The adhesion of potential probiotic (Bifidobacterium longum CECT 7347 and Bifidobacterium bifidum CECT 7365), commensal (Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis) and pathogenic (Salmonella enterica CECT 443 and Lysteria monocytogenes CECT 935) bacteria to mucin and Caco-2 cell cultures was determined. Gliadins were subjected to in vitro digestion (pepsin/pancreatin-bile), with/out GAGs, and the presence or not of cell suspensions of B. longum (108CFU/ml). B. longum, E. coli, and L. monocytogenes, markedly interact with the high-sulphur-containing fraction of GAGs. The GAGs reduced the gliadins-mediated production of interleukin-1β, but not tumour necrosis factor-α.

Probiotics are viable microorganisms that restore the gut microbiota and exert a beneficial effect on the liver by inhibiting bacterial enzymes, stimulating immunity, and protecting intestinal permeability. We evaluated Lactobacillus paracasei F19 (LP-F19), for its potential protective effect, in an experimental model of I/R (30 min ischemia and 60 min reperfusion) in rats fed a standard diet or a steatogen [methionine/choline-deficient (MCD)] diet. Both groups consisted of 7 sham-operated rats, 10 rats that underwent I/R, and 10 that underwent I/R plus 8 wk of probiotic dietary supplementation. In rats fed a standard diet, I/R induced a decrease in sinusoid perfusion (P < 0.001), severe liver inflammation, and necrosis besides an increase of tissue levels of malondialdehyde (P < 0.001), tumor necrosis factor-α (P < 0.001), interleukin (IL)-1β (P < 0.001), and IL-6 (P < 0.001) and of serum levels of transaminase (P < 0.001) and lipopolysaccharides (P < 0.001) vs. sham-operated rats. I/R also induced a decrease in Bacterioides, Bifidobacterium, and Lactobacillus spps (P < 0.01, P < 0.001, and P < 0.001, respectively) and an increase in Enterococcus and Enterobacteriaceae (P < 0.01 and P < 0.001, respectively) on intestinal mucosa. The severity of liver and gut microbiota alterations induced by I/R was even greater in rats with liver inflammation and steatosis, i.e., MCD-fed animals. LP-F19 supplementation significantly reduced the harmful effects of I/R on the liver and on gut microbiota in both groups of rats, although the effect was slightly less in MCD-fed animals. In conclusion, LP-F19 supplementation, by restoring gut microbiota, attenuated I/R-related liver injury, particularly in the absence of steatosis.

GOS supported the growth of B. bifidum 02 450B throughout the fermentation. Quantitative analysis of bacterial populations by FISH revealed significant increases in Bifidobacterium spp. counts (Bif164) and a concomitant decrease in Clostridium histolyticum counts (Chis150) in the synbiotic-containing vessels compared with the controls and GOS vessels. Vessels containing probiotic alone displayed a transient increase in Bifidobacterium spp. and a transient decrease in Bacteroides spp. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis showed that GOS elicited similar alterations in the microbial profiles of the three in vitro runs. However, the synbiotic did not alter the microbial diversity of the three runs to the same extent as GOS alone. Nested PCR using universal primers, followed by bifidobacterial-specific primers illustrated low bifidobacterial diversity in dogs, which did not change drastically during the in vitro fermentation.

In addition, L. plantarum effects on plasma immunoglobulins and antioxidant capacity of the animals as well as on the milk fatty acid composition were determined. For the purpose of the experiment a field study was designed, involving 24 dairy goats of the Damascus breed, kept in a sheep and goat dairy farm. The goats were divided in terms of body weight in two treatments of 12 goats each, namely: control (CON) without addition of L. plantarum and probiotic (PRO) treatment with in feed administration of L. plantarum so that the goats would intake 12. log. CFU/day. The experiment lasted 5 weeks and at weekly time intervals individual faecal, blood and milk samples were collected and analysed. All faecal samples were examined for the presence of L. plantarum PCA 236. In addition, the culturable population levels of mesophilic aerobes, coliforms lactic acid bacteria (LAB), Streptococcus, Enterococcus, mesophilic anaerobes, Clostridium and Bacteroides in faeces were also determined by enumeration on specific culture media. In parallel, plasma IgA, IgM and IgG and antioxidant capacity of plasma and milk were determined. No adverse effects were observed in the animals receiving the lactobacillus during the experiment. Lactobacillus plantarum PCA 236 was recovered in the faeces of all animals in the PRO treatment. In addition, PRO treatment resulted in a significant (P≤. 0.05) increase in LAB coupled with a significant decrease in faecal clostridia populations compared to the CON treatment. The antioxidant capacity and the concentrations of immunoglobulins IgA, IgM and IgG in goat plasma did not differ between the treatments. In contrast, milk fat composition in the PRO treatment had a significantly higher content of polyunsaturated fatty acids such as linoleic, a-linolenic and rumenic acids compared to CON, while there were no differences in milk antioxidant capacity. The results obtained in this study, indicate that the L. plantarum PCA 236 strain has displayed an interesting probiotic potential, in terms of beneficially modulating the goat faecal microbiota and milk fatty acid composition that needs to be further researched. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",41.0

We challenged C57BL/6J mice raised under germfree conditions (GF-raised C57BL/6J mice) and Rag1-/- mice raised under germfree conditions (GF-raised Rag1 -/- mice) and under specific-pathogen-free conditions (SPF-raised Rag1-/- mice) with probiotic E. coli strain Nissle 1917, strain Nissle 1917 mutants, the commensal strain E. coli mpk, or Bacteroides vulgatus mpk.

In GF-raised Rag1-/- mice, but not in SPF-raised Rag1 -/- mice or GF-raised C57BL/6J mice, oral challenge with E. coli strain Nissle 1917, but not oral challenge with E. coli mpk, resulted in translocation and dissemination. The mortality rate was significantly higher for E. coli strain Nissle 1917-challenged GF-raised Rag1-/- mice (100%; P &lt; 0.001) than for E. coli strain Nissle 1917-challenged SPF-raised Rag1-/- mice (0%) and GF-raised C57BL/6J mice (0%). Translocation of and mortality due to strain E. coli Nissle 1917 in GF-raised Rag1-/- mice were prevented when mice were reconstituted with T cells prior to strain E. coli Nissle 1917 challenge, but not when mice were reconstituted with T cells after E. coli strain Nissle 1917 challenge. Cocolonization experiments revealed that E. coli mpk could not prevent translocation of strain E. coli Nissle 1917.

The objective of our study was to determine if increased Lactobacillus sp. in the gut flora of newborn broiler chicks and ducks could result in weight gain increase. Methodology: Female broiler chicks (Gallus gallus domesticus) and ducks (Anas platyrhynchos domestica) were separated into one control and two experimental groups, and inoculated once or twice with 4×1010 Lactobacillus spp. per animal in PBS, or with PBS alone. Fecal samples were collected before and at 24 hours, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 30 days after the inoculation. DNA was extracted from the stools, and qPCR assays were performed on a MX3000TM system for the detection and quantification of Lactobacillus sp., Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, using a quantification plasmid. Animals were measured and sacrificed 60 days after the beginning of the experiment, and livers were collected and measured. Principal Findings: Chicks inoculated once and twice with Lactobacillus weighed 10.2% (p = 0.0162) and 13.5% (p = 0.0064) more than the control group animals, respectively. Similarly, ducks inoculated once and twice weighed 7.7% (p = 0.05) and 14% (p = 0.035) more than those in the control group, respectively. Liver mass was also significantly higher in inoculated animals compared to the control group. Inoculation with Lactobacillus sp. increased the DNA copies of Lactobacillus spp. and Firmicutes in the stools. Bacteroidetes remained stable, and only the second Lactobacillus sp. inoculation significantly decreased its population in chicks. The ratio of DNA copies of Firmicutes to those of Bacteroidetes increased to as much as 6,4 in chicks and 8,3 in ducks. Conclusions: Differences in the intestinal microbiota may precede weight increase, as we found that an increase of Lactobacillus sp. in newborn ducks and chicks preceded the development of weight gain. © 2010 Angelakis, Raoult.",102.0

In this randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind study, thirty chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients treated with antibiotics for a respiratory tract infection received 5g of a multispecies probiotic or placebo twice daily for 2 weeks. Faecal samples were collected at 0, 7, 14 and 63d. Changes in the composition of the dominant faecal microbiota were determined by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Changes in bacterial subgroups were determined by quantitative PCR and culture. Bowel movements were scored daily according to the Bristol stool form scale. During and after antibiotic treatment, DGGE-based similarity indices (SI) were high (84%) and band richness was relatively low, both remaining stable over time. No difference in SI was observed between patients with and without diarrhoea-like bowel movements. The multispecies probiotic had a modest effect on the bacterial subgroups. Nevertheless, it affected neither the composition of the dominant faecal microbiota nor the occurrence of diarrhoea-like bowel movements. The dominant faecal microbiota was not affected by antibiotics in this COPD population, suggesting an existing imbalance of the microbiota, which may also have contributed to the lack of effect by probiotic intake. © 2010 The Authors.",18.0

For example, recent data have proposed that dysbiosis of gut microbiota (at phyla, genus, or species level) affects host metabolism and energy storage.

Traditional and real-time PCR were optimized to detect and quantify Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacterium spp. in complex microbial community. Fish and shrimp sauce were used as a model for complex microbial community. Directly form samples, 4 DNA extraction methods, primers specificity, PCR, and real-time PCR procedures were optimized, tested in comparison with samples, enriched bacteria and related standard bacterial strains, E. coli, Bacteroides, Enterococcus and Salmonella. Results showed that extracted genomic DNA using Wizard® Genomic DNA Purification Kit showed the highest yield, quality and performance. Moreover, the specificity of the primer set specific for Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacterium spp. was checked and found highly specific. The sensitivity of real-time PCR was higher than the conventional PCR and its quantifying potential is very precise for the detection and quantification of Lactobacillus spp. but not Bifidobacterium spp. which was absent in the tested samples. In conclusion, PCR and real-time PCR assays could be used very efficiently in quantifying and detecting Lactobacillus spp. that are present in very PCR-suppressive and complex microbial environment. © 2010 Academic Journals.",18.0

The search for mediators that fine tune cholesterol homeostasis has recognised probiotics as being potentially beneficial. Here, we present data describing bacterial regulation of Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1), which, when weakly expressed, results in a marked reduction in intestinal absorption of cholesterol. The probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356 reduced NPC1L1 gene expression and inhibited the cellular uptake of micellar cholesterol in Caco-2 cells. Soluble effector molecules secreted by ATCC 4356 were shown to be responsible for the decrease in NPC1L1. Furthermore, ATCC 4356 mediated this effect partly through the liver X receptors (LXR). The role of NPC1L1 and the LXR in cholesterol metabolism underscores the basis for the use of probiotics, such as ATCC 4356, in managing hypercholesterolaemia.",85.0

However, stimulation of such microbes does not necessarily imply a preventive effect against pathogen infection. We recently demonstrated a reduced resistance to Salmonella infection in mice fed diets containing fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) or xylo-oligosaccharides (XOS). In the present study, faecal and caecal samples from the same mice were analysed in order to study microbial changes potentially explaining the observed effects on the pathogenesis of Salmonella. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis revealed that the microbiota in faecal samples from mice fed FOS or XOS were different from faecal samples collected before the feeding trial as well as from faecal profiles generated from control animals. This difference was not seen for caecal profiles. Further analysis of faecal samples by real-time PCR demonstrated a significant increase in the Bacteroidetes phylum, the Bacteroides fragilis group and in Bifidobacterium spp. in mice fed FOS or XOS. The observed bifidogenic effect was more pronounced for XOS than for FOS. The Firmicutes phylum and the Clostridium coccoides group were reduced by both FOS and XOS. Surprisingly, no significant differences were detected between faecal samples collected before and after pathogen challenge in any of the groups. Furthermore, no effect of diets on caecal concentrations of short-chain fatty acids was recorded. In conclusion, diets supplemented with FOS or XOS induced a number of microbial changes in the faecal microbiota of mice. The observed effects of XOS were qualitatively similar to those of FOS, but the most prominent bifidogenic effect was seen for XOS. An increased level of bifidobacteria is thus not in itself preventive against Salmonella infection, since the same XOS or FOS-fed mice were previously reported to be more severely affected by Salmonella than control animals. © 2010 Wageningen Academic Publishers.",26.0

The fermentation of xylo-oligosaccharides, xylan, galacto-oligosaccharide, fructo-oligosaccharide, polydextrose, lactitol, gentiobiose and pullulan was investigated in vitro. The ability of these established and potential prebiotic candidates to function as a sole carbon source for probiotic (Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus), intestinal and potential pathogenic microbes (Eubacterium, Bacteroides, Clostridium, Escherichia coli, Salmonella, and Staphylococcus) was assessed in pure cultures. Xylo-oligosaccharides were fermented with high specificity by the tested Bifidobacterium lactis strains and lactitol by lactobacilli, whereas galacto-oligosaccharides, fructo-oligosaccharides and gentiobiose were utilised by a larger group of microbes. Xylan, polydextrose and pullulan were utilised to a limited extent by only a few of the tested microbes. The results of this screening study indicate that xylo-oligosaccharides and lactitol support the growth of a limited number of beneficial microbes in pure cultures.

"Swidsinski A., Loening-Baucke V., Herber A.",Mucosal flora in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis - An overview,2009,Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology,,"The intestinal flora harbors varies pathogens. Clostridium perfringens (gas gangrene), Enterococci (endocarditis), Enterobacteriaceae (sepsis), Bacteroides (abscesses) are present in the large intestine of every healthy person in high concentrations. These bacteria are, however, separated from the colonic wall by an impenetrable mucus layer and are tolerated by the host. This separation is disturbed in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), where bacteria adhere to the mucosa and invade epithelial cells with concomitant inflammatory response. This chronic bowel inflammation can not subside as long as the mucus barrier remains defective. The inflammatory response interferes with the state of tolerance to the intestinal bacteria and leads to characteristic changes in the biostructure of the faecal microbiota. These changes in the biostructure of faecal microbiota are specific for active Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (UC) and can be longitudinally monitored. The reason for the defect of the mucus barrier in IBD patients is unclear. Epidemiologic studies indicate a negative role of western lifestyle and foods and document the rise in the incidence of IBD in the industrialized countries during the 20th century. In parallel to this, detergents were introduced in households and emulsifiers were increasingly added to food. The cleaning effect of these on the colonic mucus has to be investigated. The present contribution summarizes new data on the biostructure of the intestinal microbiota.",110.0

Methods and Results: The growth of single microbial strains was first assessed for both substrates in pure cultures, and panose was further analysed in the simulated colon model with mixed human faecal culture. Quantitative PCR and flow cytometry were used to determine the microbial group and strain densities after the simulated colonic fermentation of panose, and chromatographic methods were utilized to analyse metabolite concentrations. In pure cultures, sophorose and panose were both fermented only by few beneficial strains, and in the colon simulator, panose gave a significant increase in the numbers of Bifidobacterium and Bifidobacterium lactis, concomitantly decreasing Bacteroides group. Butyrate and acetate production was significantly increased together with decreased markers of protein fermentation as a result of panose fermentation. Conclusions: Panose had bifidogenic activities in vitro, and these potential beneficial effects should be further assessed in vitro and in vivo.

Microbial breakdown of both oligosaccharides and short-chain fatty acid production was colon compartment specific, with ascending and transverse colon being the predominant site of inulin and AXOS degradation, respectively. Lactate levels (+5.5 mM) increased in the ascending colon during AXOS supplementation, while propionate levels (+5.1 mM) increased in the transverse colon. The concomitant decrease in lactate in the transverse colon suggests that propionate was partially formed over the acrylate pathway. Furthermore, AXOS supplementation strongly decreased butyrate in the ascending colon, this in parallel with a decrease in Roseburia spp. and Bacteroides/Prevotella/Porphyromonas (-1.4 and -2.0 log CFU) levels. Inulin treatment had moderate effects on lactate, propionate and butyrate levels. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis revealed that inulin changed microbial metabolism by modulating the microbial community composition. In contrast, AXOS primarily affected microbial metabolism by 'switching on' AXOS-degrading enzymes (xylanase, arabinofuranosidase and xylosidase), without significantly affecting microbial community composition. Our results demonstrate that AXOS has a higher potency than inulin to shift part of the sugar fermentation toward the distal colon parts. Furthermore, due to its stronger propionate-stimulating effect, AXOS is a candidate prebiotic capable of lowering cholesterol and beneficially affecting fat metabolism of the host. © 2009 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.",148.0

Methods: Forty seven children with confirmed birch pollen allergy were randomized to receive either a probiotic combination of Lactobacillus acidophilus (L. acidophilus) NCFM™ (ATCC 700396) and Bifidobacterium lactis (B. lactis) Bl-04 (ATCC SD5219) or placebo in a double-blind manner for 4 mo, starting prior to onset of the birch pollen season. Symptoms were recorded in a diary. Blood samples were taken for analysis of cytokines and eosinophils. Fecal samples were analysed for microbiota components, calprotectin and IgA. Nasal swabs were taken for analysis of eosinophils. Results: The pollen season induced a reduction in Bifidobacterium, Clostridium and Bacteroides which could not be prevented by the probiotic intervention. During the intervention, significantly higher numbers of B. lactis 11.2 × 107 ± 4.2 × 107 vs 0.1 × 107 ± 0.1 × 107 bacteria/g feces (P &lt; 0.0001) and L. acidophilus NCFM™ 3.5 × 106 ± 1.3 × 106 vs 0.2 × 106 ± 0.1 × 106 bacteria/g feces (P &lt; 0.0001) were observed in the probiotic group compared to the placebo group. During May, there was a tendency for fewer subjects, (76.2% vs 95.2%, P = 0.078) to report runny nose, while during June, fewer subjects, 11.1% vs 33.3%, reported nasal blocking in the probiotics group (P = 0.101). Concomitantly, fewer subjects in the probiotic group had infiltration of eosinophils in the nasal mucosa compared to the placebo group, 57.1% vs 95% (P = 0.013). Eye symptoms tended to be slightly more frequent in the probiotic group, 12.5 d [interquartile range (IQR) 6-18] vs 7.5 d (IQR 0-11.5) (P = 0.066) during May. Fecal IgA was increased in the placebo group during the pollen season; this increase was prevented by the probiotics (P = 0.028). Conclusion: Birch pollen allergy was shown to be associated with changes in fecal microbiota composition. The specific combination of probiotics used was shown to prevent the pollen-induced infiltration of eosinophils into the nasal mucosa, and indicated a trend for reduced nasal symptoms. © 2009 The WJG Press and Baishideng.

In healthy individuals, the human stomach and the proximal small bowel contain only a few bacterial species, with the terminal ileum considered a transitional zone between the proximal small bowel aerobic microflora and the colonic anaerobic bacteria. The colon hosts a complex and variegate microbiota, including anaerobes (bacteroides, bifidobacteria, lactobacilli and clostridium), and several other species. The enteric microflora is involved in protective, trophic and metabolic functions. The interaction between gut microflora and substrate leads to gas production, while their overproduction can be responsible of the ""gas-related syndrome"", a constellation of non-specific gastrointestinal symptoms (bloating, borborygms, flatulence, abdominal distension and discomfort). Any condition leading to the perturbation of the equilibrium between enteric flora and the surrounding system is a predisposing factor for bacterial overgrowth.

However, interactions between commensal bacteria and colonic epithelial cells have not been fully investigated. We therefore assessed the ability of various commensal bacteria and probiotics to adhere to and invade colonic epithelial cells. Effects of the bacteria on production of proinflammatory cytokines were also measured. Commensal bacteria, including mucosal organisms isolated from ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, such as Fusobacterium varium, reported as a possible pathogen in UC, Bacteroides vulgatus, Escherichia coli and Clostridium clostridioforme, as well as their type strains and probiotics, were assessed for their ability to adhere to and invade colonic epithelial cells using two cell lines, SW-480 and HT-29. Our experiments employed co-incubation, a combination of scanning and transmission electron microscopy and recovery of bacteria from infected-cell lysates. F. varium and several other commensal bacteria, but not probiotics, adhered to colonic epithelial cells and invaded their cytoplasm. ELISA and real-time PCR revealed that the host cells, particularly those invaded by F. varium, showed significant increases in IL-8 and TNF-α concentrations in supernatants, with elevation of IL-8, TNF-α, MCP-1 and IL-6 mRNAs. Furthermore, IL-8 and TNF-α expression and nuclear phosphorylated NF-κB p65 expression could be immunohistochemically confirmed in inflamed epithelium with cryptitis or crypt abscess in UC patients.

Healthy subjects administered amoxicillin/clavulanate were randomized and concomitantly received a placebo or probiotic mixture. The primary end point was similarity of faecal microbiota as determined by culturing and TRFLP from subjects taking probiotics compared to those taking a placebo measured by comparing data from baseline to post-treatment for each subject. TRFLP analysis revealed a high subject to subject variation in the baseline faecal microbiota. The most common antibiotic-induced disturbance was a relative increase in Clostridium, Eubacterium, Bacteroides and Enterobacteraceae. The mean similarity to the baseline increased over time in both treatment groups, although the probiotic group was less disturbed according to both TRFLP and culture data. The culture method revealed that postantibiotic faecal microbiota in probiotic-consuming subjects were more similar to the baseline microbiota than the control group (P=0.046). Changes in Enterobactereaceae (P=0.006) and Bifidobacterium (P=0.030) counts were significantly different between the groups.

We evaluated the influence of the administration of S. boulardii on the composition of the fecal microbiota in a human microbiota-associated mouse model. This evaluation was run before, during and after a 7-day oral treatment with amoxicillin clavulanic acid. Predominant groups of bacteria were quantified with fluorescence in situ hybridization combined with flow cytometry using group-specific 16S rRNA targeted oligonucleotide probes designed for the Eubacteria, Bacteroides-Porphyromonas-Prevotella, Clostridium coccoides-Eubacterium rectale, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Clostridium histolyticum, Lactobacillus-Enterococcus and Enterobacteriaceae groups and Bifidobacterium species. S. boulardii did not quantitatively alter the total anaerobic microbiota nor the dominant bacterial groups. During the antibiotic treatment in the two groups of mice receiving the yeast or not, the level of Enterobacteriaceae and Bacteroides groups increased when the C. coccoides-E. rectale group decreased dramatically. After the antibiotic treatment was discontinued, the return to the initial level was reached more rapidly in the S. boulardii-treated mice than in the control mice (p<0.05) for the C. coccoides-E. rectale and Bacteroides-Porphyromonas-Prevotella groups. This quicker recovery of normal intestinal microbiota equilibrium after antibiotic therapy could be a mechanism for S. boulardii preventive effect on antibiotic-associated diarrhea in humans. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

To understand the involvement of intestinal microflora in the pathogenesis of IBD, we analyzed the constituents of intestinal microflora in IBD. Faecal samples from 73 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 23 patients with Crohn's disease (CD) were analyzed by quantitative PCR using 16S rRNA gene-targeted group-specific primers for Bacteroides fragilis group, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium coccoides groups, Clostridium leptum subgroup, Atopobium cluster, and seven species of Bacteroides. We analyzed the distribution of the predominant microflora by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using group-specific probes. We also examined the concentration of faecal organic acids produced by intestinal microflora. Contrary to previous reports, we found that the B. fragilis group was significantly decreased in the faeces of patients with IBD. Moreover, B. vulgatus was the predominant microflora in healthy controls and relatively decreased among IBD patients. Most of the microflora adhering to the colonic mucosa surrounding the mucus layer comprised C. coccoides group and Bifidobacterium. B. fragilis group mainly inhabited the faeces, but did not adhere to or invade the mucosa. The concentrations of propionic and butyric acids in the faeces were significantly decreased in patients with IBD. These findings indicate that IBD is not caused by a specific intestinal bacterial cluster or species and that disordered intestinal microflora could be involved in the pathogenesis of IBD. © 2007 Elsevier GmbH.

Patients and Methods: The study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised intervention trial in which 82 healthy, full-term, partially breast-fed children, from 1 week to 3 months old, were given 1 of the following formulae: whey-based formula (control group), whey-based formula with galacto- and long-chain fructo-oligosaccharides (scGOS/lcFOS group), or whey-based formula with galactoand long-chain fructo-oligosaccharides added with pectinderived acidic oligosaccharides (scGOS/lcFOS/ pAOS group). Children were studied for the duration of the partial formula feeding period and every 2 weeks for 2 months after breast-feeding cessation. The total bacteria count and the proportion of 7 bacterial families were determined using in situ hybridisation coupled to flow cytometry. Results: The total bacterial count did not alter with time or type of feeding (9.9±0.1 log10 cells per gram wet weight). Compared with the control group, there was an increase of the Bifidobacterium genus (P=0.0001), and a decrease of proportions for the Bacteroides group (P=0.02) and the Clostridium coccoides group (P=0.01) in both oligosaccharide groups. The proportion of bifidobacteria was significantly higher in the scGOS/lcFOS/pAOS compared with the scGOS/lcFOS group (P<0.01). Conclusions: Infant formulae appear to be clinically safe and effective on infant microbiota. They minimize the alteration of faecal microbiota after cessation of breast-feeding and promote bifidobacteria proportions, with a stronger effect when acidic oligosaccharides are present. ©2008 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",48.0

Fifteen healthy adults ingested a daily serving of one of three commercial yogurts (two of the products contained a probiotic lactobacilli strain) for 20 days. Fecal samples at defined time points before, during, and after the period of yogurt ingestion were collected and analyzed. The fecal population of lactobacilli was determined by a culture-based method and subsequent colony PCR for the identification of species. Six predominant bacterial groups in the fecal samples were quantitatively determined based on a sequence-specific SSU rRNA cleavage method coupled with a suite of oligonucleotide probes, which was optimized for the target-specific detection of bacterial groups inhabiting human feces. In the ingestion period, one probiotic strain was detected in the feces of all five subjects who consumed the yogurt containing the strain, while the other strain was detected in three of another five subjects. The population levels of the two major groups (Bacteroides and Prevotella, and the Clostridium coccoides-Eubacterium rectale group) in the fecal samples tended to change in response to the ingestion but the change did not seem to be dependent on the product-specific property of each yogurt. These results suggest that the human fecal bacterial community could be altered by ingesting yogurt, although whether probiotic lactobacilli are present or absent in the yogurt does not seem to be a factor in this change. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

"Tanaka K., Noda S., Ishikawa H., Hata A., Sawamura S.",Role of microbiota in oral tolerance induction and infection,2008,International Journal of Probiotics and Prebiotics,,"The roles of microbiota in oral tolerance induction and viral infection were investigated using germfree (GF) mice, which lacked the microbiota. In SPF mice, oral tolerance was induced both in Th1 (IgG2a production) and Th2 (IgG1 and IgE)-meditated immune responses. In contrast, in GF mice, oral tolerance was induced in the Th1 responses, but not in the Th2 responses. The GF mouse was thus considered to be a model of IgE-mediated allergic disorder. When GF were associated with Bifidobacterium infantis, oral tolerance was restored in the gnotobiotes to a level similar to that observed in SPF. In addition, when the SPF-BALB/c mice were infected with murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV), high frequencies of MCMV-specific CD8 memory T cells were detected in the lungs even at 8 months after infection In contrast, the frequencies in the infected GF mice were significantly lower than those in SPF mice. The reconstitution of microbiota of MCMV-infected GF mice restored the frequencies of the memory T cells to the levels similar to those in SPF mice. These results may suggest probiotics may be a useful material not only for the treatment of IgE-mediated allergic disorder but also for maintaining the virus-specific memory T cells.

Numerous reports have implied that the fecal microflora may contribute to the pathogenesis of NEC. A broad range of organisms generally found in the distal gastrointestinal tract have been recovered from the peritoneal cavity and blood of infants with NEC. The predominant organisms include Enterobacteriaceae (i.e., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae), Clostridium spp., enteric pathogens (salmonellae, Coxsackie B2 virus, coronavirus, rotavirus), and potential pathogens (Bacteroides fragilis). The goals of the initial management is preventing ongoing damage, restoring hemostasis, and minimizing complications. Medical management includes withholding oral feeding, placement of nasogastric tube, abdominal decompression, paracentesis, vigorous intravenous hydration containing electrolytes and calories, support of the circulation, administration of antibiotics, and surveillance for deterioration or complications that require surgical intervention. Indications for surgery include clinical deterioration, perforation, peritonitis, obstruction, and abdominal mass. Prevention remains crucial to decrease the incidence of NEC. Preventive methods include cautious feeding regimens, the use of maternal breast milk, and the use of probiotics. Copyright © 2008 by Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc.",42.0

This study aimed to determine whether prior administration of probiotic lactobacilli and bifidobacteria would prevent disease and change gut flora in an animal model of colitis. Methods: Swiss albino mice received a probiotic mixture (four Lactobacillus and four Bifidobacterium species) or medium (control) for a week prior to induction of colitis by oral 4% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) for seven days. Appropriate non-colitis controls were used. Histological damage was assessed (n = 5 per group), as was expression of mRNA for tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interferon (IFN)-γ, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 and SOCS-1 in the colonic mucosa (n = 6 per group). Secretion of TNF-α was measured in distal colon organ culture (n = 5-6 per group). Levels of Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, and Lactobacillus acidophilus in feces were quantified by real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting 16S rDNA. Results: Compared to untreated DSS colitis, probiotic treatment significantly reduced weight loss (P < 0.05), shifted histological damage to lesser grades of severity (P < 0.001), reduced mRNA expression of TNF-α and TGF-β1 (P < 0.05), and down-regulated production of TNF-α from distal colon explants (P < 0.05). Colitis induced a significant reduction in the relative proportions of Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides and Lactobacillus acidophilus group bacteria in feces, and these levels were significantly increased in probiotic-treated mice compared to DSS mice (P < 0.001). Conclusion: Prior administration of probiotic bacteria reduced mucosal inflammation and damage in DSS-induced colitis.

Despite the universal assumption of this assertion, several researchers have evaluated the real capability of the yogurt bacteria Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus to survive and proliferate in the human intestine and have found contradictory results. Objective: This double-blind crossover study assessed the qualitative and quantitative effects of fresh and heat-treated yogurt on bacterial intestinal microbiota from healthy subjects. Design: The subjects were divided into experimental (n = 63) and control (n = 16) groups. The experimental group consumed fresh and heat-treated yogurt for 15 d according to a crossover design with a washout period of 2 wk. Three different fecal samples per individual were recovered: at baseline, after fresh yogurt intake, and after heat-treated yogurt intake. Qualitative changes in microbiota were studied by denaturing gel gradient electrophoresis (DGGE) with universal and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) 16S-rRNA primers. Quantitative changes in LAB, Clostridium coccoides, Clostridium perfringens, and Bacteroides groups were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results: A particular DGGE stable band pattern was observed in each sample. No significant qualitative differences were detected in any fecal sample. However, a significantly higher density of LAB and C. perfringens and a significant decrease in the density of Bacteroides was observed after consumption of both types of yogurt. Microbiota density was not significantly different between the fresh and heat-treated yogurt groups, except for LAB, which was significantly greater in the fresh yogurt group. Conclusion: The main change in human microbiota observed after yogurt consumption was an increase in the density of LAB and C. perfringens to the detriment of Bacteroides.

Methods and Results: Using the well-diffusion method, we studied the antimicrobial properties of a multispecies probiotic product (Ecologic 641) against a collection of pathogens cultured from infected pancreatic necrosis. All individual probiotic strains included in the multispecies preparation were able to inhibit the growth of the pathogens to some extent. However, the combination of the individual strains (i.e. the multispecies preparation) was able to inhibit all pathogenic isolates. Probiotic-free supernatants adjusted to pH 7 were not able to inhibit pathogen growth. Conclusion: Ecologic 641 is capable of inhibiting growth of a wide variety of pathogens isolated from infected pancreatic necrosis. The antimicrobial properties are to a large extent explained by the production of organic acids.

Oral administration of heat-killed Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris H61 (strain H61) to aged SAMP6 mice was associated with reduced bone density loss, a suppression of incidence of skin ulcers and reduced hair loss, compared with controls. Spleen cells from mice fed strain H61 produced more interferon-γ and IL-12 than those from control mice, suggesting that administration of strain H61 altered immune responses. The numbers of viable cells of Bifidobacterium sp., Bacteroides sp. and Enterococcus sp. in faeces were similar for mice fed the strain H61 and control diets, but counts for Staphylococcus sp. were significantly lower (P<0.05) in mice fed strain H61. Mice fed strain H61 had similar serum concentrations of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances as in controls, indicating a lack of effect on lipid peroxidation status.

Furthermore, the 2004 study found that intestinal bacteria such as the Bacteroides fragilis group significantly fluctuated during the pollen season in JCPsis individuals and intake of BB536 yogurt tended to suppress these fluctuations. The present study investigated faecal microbiota to examine whether any changes occurred during the pollen season and whether any influence was exerted by intake of BB536 powder in the 2005 pollen season, which happened to be a heavy season, to confirm the 2004 findings and to evaluate the relationship of microbiota with symptom development. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 44 JCPsis subjects received BB536 or a placebo for 13 weeks during the pollen season. Another 14 Japanese cedar pollen (JCP)-specific IgE negative healthy subjects received placebo for the same period. Faecal samples were collected before (week 0), during (weeks 4, 8 and 13) and after (week 17) intervention, and out of JCP season (week 28). Faecal microbiota were analysed using terminal-RFLP (T-RFLP) and real-time PCR methods. Principal component analysis based on T-RFLP indicated distinct patterns of microbiota between healthy subjects and JCPsis subjects in the placebo group, but an intermediate pattern in the BB536 group at week 13, the last stage of the pollen season. The coordinate of principal component 1 at week 13 correlated with composite scores of JCPsis symptoms recorded during the pollen season. Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and the Bacteroides fragilis group were identified as the main contributors to microbiotal fluctuations. Real-time PCR indicated that BB536 intake suppressed increases in the Bacteroides fragilis group compared with the placebo group (P <0.05).

Methods and Results: The adhesion was assessed by measuring the radioactivity of bacteria adhered to the human mucus. We tested 12 probiotic strains against eight selected pathogens. All strains tested were able to adhere to mucus. All probiotic strains tested were able to inhibit and displace (P < 0.05) the adhesion of Bacteroides, Clostridium, Staphylococcus and Enterobacter. In addition, the abilities to inhibit and to displace adhered pathogens depended on both the probiotic and the pathogen strains tested suggesting that several complementary mechanisms are implied in the processes. Conclusions: Our results indicate the need for a case-by-case assessment in order to select strains with the ability to inhibit or displace a specific pathogen. Probiotics could be useful to correct deviations observed in intestinal microbiota associated with specific diseases and also, to prevent pathogen infections.

Methods and Results: The diversity of intestinal bacteria in the Chinese mitten crabs was investigated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) fingerprinting, 16S rRNA gene clone library analysis and real-time quantitative PCR. The principal component analysis of DGGE profiles indicated that substantial intersubject variations existed in intestinal bacteria in pond-raised crab. The sequencing of 16S rRNA genes revealed that 90-95% of the phylotypes in the clone libraries were affiliated with Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. Some genera were identified as unique in wild crabs and in pond-raised crabs, whereas Bacteroidetes was found to be common in all sampled crab groups. Real-time quantitative PCR indicated that the abundance of Bacteroides and the total bacterial load were approximately four-to-10 times higher in pond-raised crabs than in wild crabs. A significant portion of the phylotypes shared low similarity with previously sequenced organisms, indicating that the bacteria in the gut of Chinese mitten crabs are yet to be described. Conclusions: The intestinal bacteria of pond-raised crabs showed higher intersubject variation, total diversity and abundance than that observed in wild crabs. The high proportion of the clones of Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes in the clone library is an indication that these bacteria may be the dominant population in the gut of the Chinese mitten crab. Significance and Impact of the Study: This study demonstrated obvious differences in the intestinal bacterial composition of pond-raised crabs and wild crabs. This knowledge will increase our understanding of the effects of aquaculture operations on bacterial community composition in the crab gut and provide necessary data for the development of probiotic products for crab cultivation. © 2007 Shanghai Jiaotong University.",48.0

The study was double-blinded and comprised 66 healthy adults (22 male, 44 female), mean age 40 years (range, 22-60 years). After a 12-d baseline period the subjects were randomized to consume, for 3 weeks, 3 x 200 ml daily of either (1) a fermented milk with probiotics (Bifidobacterium longum BB536, Bifidobacterium spp. 420 and Lactobacillus acidophilus 145), (2) a fermented milk with the same probiotics plus 4 g inulin, or (3) a control fermented milk. During the last 7 d of the baseline and the intervention periods, the subjects kept a record of their defaecation frequency and gastrointestinal symptoms, and collected all their faeces. Intestinal transit time, stool weight and faecal enzyme activities were measured. Thirty-nine subjects were randomized to give faecal samples for analysis of pH and microbes, including lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, coliforms, Escherichia coli, Bacteroides and Clostridium perfringens. Consumption of fermented milk with probiotics or with probiotics and inulin increased the faecal number of lactobacilli (P=0.009, P=0.003) and bifidobacteria (P=0.046, P=0.038) compared with the baseline. Compared with the control fermented milk, both active products increased lactobacilli (P=0.005, ANCOVA). Subjects consuming fermented milk with probiotics and inulin suffered from gastrointestinal symptoms, especially flatulence, more than the others (P<0.001). In conclusion, the probiotic fermented milk product had a positive effect by increasing the number of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria in the colon. Inulin did not alter this effect but it increased gastrointestinal symptoms. © 2007 Proprietors of Journal of Dairy Research.",23.0

To identify putative probiotics, we tested commensal bacteria in terms of their toxicity, invasiveness, inhibition of Yersinia-induced inflammation in vitro and in vivo, and modulation of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis in mice. The commensal bacteria Escherichia coli, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bacteroides vulgatus, Bacteroides distasonis, and Streptococcus salivarius were screened for adhesion to, invasion of, and toxicity for host epithelial cells (EC), and the strains were tested for their ability to inhibit Y. enterocolitica-induced NF-κB activation. Additionally, B. adolescentis was administered to mice orally infected with Y. enterocolitica and to mice with mucosae impaired by DSS treatment. None of the commensal bacteria tested was toxic for or invaded the EC. B. adolescentis, B. distasonis, B. vulgatus, and S. salivarius inhibited the Y. enterocolitica- induced NF-κB activation and interleukin-8 production in EC. In line with these findings, B. adolescentis-fed mice had significantly lower results for mean pathogen burden in the visceral organs, intestinal tumor necrosis factor alpha mRNA expression, and loss of body weight upon oral infection with Y. enterocolitica. In addition, the administration of B. adolescentis decelerated inflammation upon DSS treatment in mice. We suggest that our approach might help to identify new probiotics to be used for the treatment of inflammatory and infectious gastrointestinal disorders.

Objective: The aim of this study was to extend a previous 2-week assessment of a probiotic-prebiotic complex in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Methods: In this open-label, partially controlled, 1-year (14 [2] months) extension study, data were collected from patients with IBS who continued treatment following a 2-week study of the efficacy of the probiotic-prebiotic complex. Data were collected at 2 and ∼60 weeks after the end of the original study. Results: A total of 25 patients entered the 2-week extension and 22 completed the ∼60-week follow-up study (20 women, 2 men; age range, 20-70 years; all white). Results in the control group 2 weeks after crossover to treatment were similar to those from the original study, with reductions in IBS subsyndromes, as follows: general ill feelings/nausea (P < 0.001), indigestion/flatulence (P < 0.001), and marginally colitis (P < 0.03 [1-tailed]). Treatment was associated with a continued reduction in general ill feelings/nausea at 4 weeks (P < 0.007). At ≥52-week follow-up, the rate of remissions was 81.5% to 100% (P < 0.003). Conclusion: Based on the results from the present 1-year extension study, treatment with this probiotic-prebiotic complex may be an option for short-term (2-4 weeks) and long-term (∼60-week) reductions in IBS symptoms. © 2007 Excerpta Medica, Inc.

Objective: In the present study, fecal microbiota were investigated to examine whether any changes occur during the pollen season and whether any influence is exerted by probiotic intake. Methods: Yogurt either with BB536 (BB536 yogurt) or without BB536 (placebo yogurt) was administered for 14 weeks at 2 x 100 g per day to 40 subjects (17 men, 23 women) with a clinical history of JCPsis. Fecal samples were obtained from 23 subjects (placebo group, n = 13; BB536 group, n = 10) before and during the intervention (weeks 4, 9 and 13) and fecal microbiota were analyzed using terminalrestriction fragment length polymorphism and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods. Results: From the fluctuation patterns of terminal-restriction fragments, the Bacteroides fragilis group and bifidobacteria were among the species that changed most with pollen dispersion. Real-time PCR analyses indicated that the cell numbers of the B fragilis group increased significantly along with pollen dispersion in both BB536 and placebo groups. Cell numbers of bifidobacteria were significantly higher in the BB536 group compared with the placebo group (P &lt; .05 at weeks 4 and 9). The ratio of cell numbers of the B fragilis group to bifidobacteria increased significantly during the pollen season in the placebo group (P &lt; .01 at weeks 9 and 14), but not in the BB536 group. An in vitro study using peripheral blood mononuclear cells from JCPsis subjects indicated that strains of the B fragilis group induced significantly more helper T cell (TH) type2 cytokines (interleukin [IL]-6) but fewer TH1 cytokines (IL-12 and interferon) compared with those of bifidobacteria. Conclusions: These results suggest a relationship between fluctuation in intestinal microbiota and pollinosis allergy. Furthermore, intake of BB536 yogurt appears to exert positive influences on the formation of anti-allergic microbiota. © 2007 Esmon Publicidad.",40.0
Wilks M.,Bacteria and early human development,2007,Early Human Development,10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2007.01.007,"Our understanding of the relationship between microbes and their animal hosts have changed dramatically in the last decade. The development of powerful new molecular methods as well as different animal models, particularly germ free rodents, has enabled precise characterisation of the ways in which commensal bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract and other areas interact with their hosts. It is now clear that animal development, far from being genetically determined is intimately bound up with the microbial flora of that particular animal. In germ free mice, the addition of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron mediates the maturation and function of the gastrointestinal tract in several different ways. Similarly Bacteroides fragilis directs the development of the immune system both in and outside the gastrointestinal tract.

The influence of inulin on the microbial composition, pH, consistency and amount of faeces, and on frequency of defecation was assessed. Methods: In this study a daily dosage of 0.25 g/kg/d was used: 3 weeks of inulin consumption were followed by 3 weeks without or vice versa. The study group consisted of 14 babies with an average age of 12.6 weeks (± 6.4 weeks) and the average intake of inulin was 1.5 (± 0.3) g/d. Results: The consumption of inulin increased the content of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus in the faeces of formula-fed babies, without affecting the number of Bacteroides or the total anaerobic count. With inulin there was a trend for stools to become softer and for the amount of faeces to increase significantly. Frequency of defecation was not affected by the consumption of inulin. No adverse effects were reported during the periods of inulin consumption. Conclusions: We conclude that, with native inulin, a prebiotic effect can be observed in formula-fed babies. Inulin may therefore be a useful ingredient in infant formulae.",47.0

Although the aetiology of IBD is unknown, an immune-mediated response to a luminal antigen is thought to be involved. As knowledge concerning the colonic microflora of cats is limited and requires further investigation, the purpose of this study was to determine the presence of specific bacterial groups in normal and IBD cats, and the potential role they play in the health of the host. Total bacterial populations, Bacteroides spp., Bifidobacterium spp., Clostridium histolyticum subgp., Lactobacillus-Enterococcus subgp. and Desulfovibrio spp. were enumerated in 34 healthy cats and 11 IBD cats using fluorescence in situ hybridisation. The study is one of the first to show the presence of Desulfovibrio in cats. Total bacteria, Bifidobacterium spp. and Bacteroides spp. counts were all significantly higher in healthy cats when compared with IBD cats, whereas Desulfovibrio spp. (producers of toxic sulphides) numbers were found to be significantly higher in colitic cats. The information obtained from this study suggests that modulation of bacterial flora by increasing bifidobacteria and decreasing Desulfovibrio spp. may be beneficial to cats with IBD.

However, dietary polyphenols are not completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and are metabolized by the gut microflora so that they and their metabolites may accumulate to exert physiological effects. In this study, we investigated the influence of the phenolic components of a tea extract and their aromatic metabolites upon bacterial growth. Fecal homogenates containing bacteria significantly catalyzed tea phenolics, including epicatechin, catechin, 3-O-methyl gallic acid, gallic acid and caffeic acid to generate aromatic metabolites dependent on bacterial species. Different strains of intestinal bacteria had varying degrees of growth sensitivity to tea phenolics and metabolites. Growth of certain pathogenic bacteria such as Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile and Bacteroides spp. was significantly repressed by tea phenolics and their derivatives, while commensal anaerobes like Clostridium spp., Bifidobacterium spp. and probiotics such as Lactobacillus sp. were less severely affected. This indicates that tea phenolics exert significant effects on the intestinal environment by modulation of the intestinal bacterial population, probably by acting as metabolic prebiotics. Our observations provide further evidence for the importance of colonic bacteria in the metabolism, absorption and potential activity of phenolics in human health and disease. The bioactivity of different phenolics may play an important role in the maintenance of gastrointestinal health. © 2006 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.",494.0

In this study, a long-term placebo-controlled crossover feeding study in which each subject received several treatments was performed to monitor the effect of a prebiotic substrate (i.e., lactulose), a probiotic organism (i.e., Saccharomyces boulardii), and their synbiotic combination on the fecal microbiota of three groups of 10 healthy human subjects differing in prebiotic dose and/or intake of placebo versus synbiotic. For this purpose, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis of 16S rRNA gene amplicons was used to detect possible changes in the overall bacterial composition using the universal V3 primer and to detect possible changes at the subpopulation level using group-specific primers targeting the Bacteroides fragilis subgroup, the genus Bifidobacterium, the Clostridium lituseburense group (cluster XI), and the Clostridium coccoides-Eubacterium rectale group (cluster XIVa). Although these populations remained fairly stable based on DGGE profiling, one pronounced change was observed in the universal fingerprint profiles after lactulose ingestion. Band position analysis and band sequencing revealed that a band appearing or intensifying following lactulose administration could be assigned to the species Bifidobacterium adolescentes. Subsequent analysis with real-time PCR (RT-PCR) indicated a statistically significant increase (P &lt; 0.05) in total bifidobacteria in one of the three subject groups after lactulose administration, whereas a similar but nonsignificant trend was observed in the other two groups. Combined RT-PCR results from two subject groups indicated a borderline significant increase (P = 0.074) of B. adolescentis following lactulose intake. The probiotic yeast S. boulardii did not display any detectable universal changes in the DGGE profiles, nor did it influence the bifidobacterial levels. This study highlighted the capacity of an integrated approach consisting of DGGE analysis and RT-PCR to monitor and quantify pronounced changes in the fecal microbiota of healthy subjects upon functional food administration.

However, the capacity of lupin kernel fiber (LKFibre), a novel legume-derived food ingredient, to act as a prebiotic and modulate the colonic microbiota in humans needed investigation. Aim of the study: The present study aimed to determine the effect of LKFibre on human intestinal microbiota by quantitative fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. Design: A total of 18 free-living healthy males between the ages of 24 and 64 years consumed a control diet and a LKFibre diet (containing an additional 17-30 g/day fiber beyond that of the control-incorporated into daily food items) for 28 days with a 28-day washout period in a single-blind, randomized, crossover dietary intervention design. Methods: Fecal samples were collected for 3 days towards the end of each diet and microbial populations analyzed by FISH analysis using 16S rRNA gene-based oligonucleotide probes targeting total and predominant microbial populations. Results: Significantly higher levels of Bifidobacterium spp. (P = 0.001) and significantly lower levels of the clostridia group of C. ramosum, C. spiroforme and C. cocleatum (P = 0.039) were observed on the LKFibre diet compared with the control. No significant differences between the LKFibre and the control diet were observed for total bacteria, Lactobacillus spp., the Eubacterium spp., the C. histolyticum/C. lituseburense group and the Bacteroides-Prevotella group. Conclusions: Ingestion of LKFibre stimulated colonic bifidobacteria growth, which suggests that this dietary fiber may be considered as a prebiotic and may beneficially contribute to colon health. © Steinkopff Verlag 2006.",49.0

In this work, quantitative information on levels and spatial distributions of Bacteroides spp, Eubacterium spp, Clostridium spp, Escherichia coli, Bifidobacterium spp and Lactobacillus/Enterococcus spp. along the porcine large intestine was investigated using 16S rRNA targeted probes and fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH). Caecum, ascending colon (AC) and rectum luminal digesta from three groups of individually housed growing pigs fed either a corn-soybean basal diet (CON diet) or a prebiotic diet containing 10 g/kg oligofructose (FOS diet) or trans-galactooligosaccharides (TOS diet) at the expense of cornstarch were analysed. DAPI staining was used to enumerate total number of cells in the samples. Populations of total cells, Bacteroides, Eubacterium, Clostridium and Bifidobacterium declined significantly (P < 0.05) from caecum to rectum, and were not affected by dietary treatments. Populations of Lactobacillus/Enterococcus and E. coli did not differ throughout the large intestine. The relative percent (%) contribution of each bacterial group to the total cell count did not differ between caecum and rectum, with the exception of Eubacterium that was higher in the AC digesta. FISH analysis showed that the sum of all bacterial groups made up a small percentage of the total cells, which was 12.4%, 21.8% and 10.3% in caecum, AC and rectum, respectively. This supports the view that in swine, the diversity of GI microflora might be higher compared to other species. In terms of microflora metabolic activity, the substantially higher numerical trends seen in FOS and TOS treatments regarding total volatile fatty acid, acetate concentrations and glycolytic activities, it could be postulated that FOS and TOS promoted saccharolytic activities in the porcine colon. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

METHODS: The study comprised of 132 newborns whose mothers were randomized to receive placebo or Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (ATCC 53103) before delivery. The treatments of mothers/infants continued for 6 months postnatally. A specific symptom chart was used to monitor gastrointestinal symptoms and infant's crying during the 7th and the 12th weeks of life. Fluorescent in situ hybridization was used to establish the Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus/Enterococcus, Bacteroides and Clostridium counts in fecal samples at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months of age. RESULTS: Numbers of different types of stools, vomits and crying time were comparable between the groups during the 7th and the 12th weeks of life. Dominant microbiota consisted of bifidobacteria throughout the study. At 6 months, there were less clostridia in faeces in the placebo compared with the probiotic group (P = 0.026), whereas after long-term follow-up at 2 years, there were less lactobacilli/enterococci and clostridia in faeces in the probiotic group than in the placebo group (P = 0.011 and P = 0.032, respectively), reflecting the impact of clostridia as a marker of microbiota succession in healthy infants.

Such cultures are derived from the caecal contents of specific-pathogen-free birds and are administered via drinking water or spray application onto eggs in the hatchery. These cultures consist of many non-culturable and obligately anaerobic bacteria. Due to their undefined nature it is difficult to obtain approval from regulatory agencies to use these preparations as direct fed microbials for poultry. In this study, 10 batches of prototype NTCs were produced using an identical protocol over a period of 2 years. Traditional microbiological techniques and a molecular culture-independent methodology, polymerase chain reaction combined with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE), were applied to characterise these cultures and also to examine if the constituents of the NTCs were identical. Culture-dependent analysis of these cultures included plating on a variety of selective and semi-selective agars, examination of colony morphology, Gram-staining and a series of biochemical tests (API, BioMerieux, France). Two sets of PCR-DGGE studies were performed. These involved the amplification of universal and subsequently lactic acid bacteria (LAB)-specific hypervariable regions of a 16S rRNA gene by PCR. Resultant amplicons were subjected to DGGE. Sequence analysis was performed on subsequent bands present in resultant DGGE profiles using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST). Microbiological culturing techniques tended to isolate common probiotic bacterial species from the genera Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Bifidobacterium, Enterococcus, Clostridium, Escherichia, Pediococcus and Enterobacterium as well as members of the genera, Actinomyces, Bacteroides, Propionibacterium, Capnocytophaga, Proteus, and Klebsiella. Bacteroides, Enterococcus, Escherichia, Brevibacterium, Klebsiella, Lactobacillus, Clostridium, Bacillus, Eubacterium, Serratia, Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Pectobacterium and Pantoea spp. in addition to unculturable bacteria were identified as constituents of the NTCs using universal PCR-DGGE analysis. A number of the sequences detected by LAB-specific PCR-DGGE were homologous to those of a number of Lactobacillus spp., including L. fermentum, L. pontis, L. crispatus, L. salivarius, L. casei, L. suntoryeus, L. vaginalis, L. gasseri, L. aviaries, L. johnsonii, L. acidophilus, and L. mucosae in addition to a range of unculturable lactobacilli. While NTCs are successful due to their complexity, the presence of members of Lactobacillus spp. amongst other probiotic genera, in these samples possibly lends to the success of the NTC cultures as probiotics or competitive exclusion products in poultry over the decades. PCR-DGGE proved to be an effective tool in detecting non-culturable organisms present in these complex undefined cultures. In conclusion, while the culture-dependent identification methods or PCR-DGGE alone cannot comprehensively elucidate the bacterial species present in such complex cultures, their complementarity provides useful information on the identity of the constituents of NTCs and will aid in future development of defined probiotics. Moreover, for the purpose of analysing prototype NTCs during their development, PCR-DGGE overcomes the limitations associated with conventional culturing methods including their low sensitivities, inability to detect unculturable bacteria and unknown species, very slow turnabout time and poor reproducibility. This study demonstrated that PCR-DGGE is indeed more valuable in detecting predominant microbial populations between various NTCs than as an identification methodology, being more applicable as a quality control method used to analyse for batch-to-batch variation during NTC production. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Recently, controlled trials have demonstrated that probiotics are effective in maintenance of remission in pouchitis patients. However, the mechanism by which therapy with probiotics works remains elusive. This study explores the role of the bacterial and fungal flora in a controlled trial for maintenance of remission in pouchitis patients with the probiotic VSL#3 compound. Methods: The mucosa associated pouch microbiota was investigated before and after therapy with VSL#3 by analysis of endoscopic biopsies using ribosomal DNA/RNA based community fingerprint analysis, clone libraries, real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and fluorescence in situ hybridisation. Patients were recruited from a placebo controlled remission maintenance trial with VSL#3. Results: Patients who developed pouchitis while treated with placebo had low bacterial and high fungal diversity. Bacterial diversity was increased and fungal diversity was reduced in patients in remission maintained with VSL#3 (p = 0.001). Real time PCR experiments demonstrated that VSL#3 increased the total number of bacterial cells (p = 0.002) and modified the spectrum of bacteria towards anaerobic species. Taxa specific clone libraries for Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria showed that the richness and spectrum of these bacteria were altered under probiotic therapy. Conclusions: Probiotic therapy with VSL#3 increases the total number of intestinal bacterial cells as well as the richness and diversity of the bacterial microbiota, especially the anaerobic flora. The diversity of the fungal flora is repressed. Restoration of the integrity of a ""protective"" intestinal mucosa related microbiota could therefore be a potential mechanism of probiotic bacteria in inflammatory barrier diseases of the lower gastrointestinal tract.",190.0

A number of biochemical variables (enzyme activities and ammonium and short-chain fatty acid [SCFA] concentrations) thought to be influenced by the GIT microbiota were also analyzed. Total cultivatable microbial counts ranged from 1010 to 1011 cfu/g of feces. The largest populations were obligate anaerobes belonging to the Clostridium clusters, followed by species of bifidobacteria and bacteroides. Coliforms and lactobacilli were found at a more intermediate level (105-109 cfu/g). The predominant anaerobe populations remained quite constant over time, but all other microbial groups showed significant interindividual differences. Enzyme profiles were individual-dependent, but within subjects, moderate to high intersample variations over time were recorded for some activities. Fecal ammonium concentration was the most unpredictable variable; this fluctuated widely between individuals and samples. Acetic acid was the most abundant SCFA in the feces, followed by butyric and propionic acids. SCFA concentrations also varied according to the individual; some subjects showed specific profiles in terms of SCFA composition or concentration.

Prebiotics are nondigestible food components that stimulate the growth of bifidobacteria. Our aim was to evaluate the effects on the intestinal microbiota of a prebiotic-supplemented milk formula after an antibiotic treatment. A randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial was carried out in 140 infants 1-2 y of age distributed into two groups after a 1-wk amoxicillin treatment (50 mg/kg/d) for acute bronchitis. The children received for 3 wk >500 mL/d of a formula with prebiotics (4.5 g/L) or a control without prebiotics. Fecal samples were obtained on d -7 (at the beginning of the antibiotic treatment), on d 0 (end of the treatment and before formula administration), and on d 7 and 21 (during formula administration). Counts of Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus-Enterococcus, Clostridium lituseburiense cluster, Clostridium histolyticum cluster, Escherichia coli, and Bacteroides-Prevotella were evaluated by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and flow cytometry. Tolerance and gastrointestinal symptoms were recorded daily. Amoxicillin decreased total fecal bacteria and increased E. coli. The prebiotic significantly increased bifidobacteria from 8.17 ± 1.46 on d 0 to 8.54 ± 1.20 on d 7 compared with the control 8.22 ± 1.24 on d 0 versus 7.95 ± 1.54 on d 7. The Lactobacillus population showed a similar tendency while the other bacteria were unaffected. No gastrointestinal symptoms were detected during the prebiotic administration. Prebiotics in a milk formula increase fecal bifidobacteria early after amoxicillin treatment without inducing gastrointestinal symptoms.

Science. B.,10.1631/jzus.2006.B0987,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of live combined Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus and Enterococcus capsules in treatment of irritable bowel syndrome. METHODS: Eighty-five patients [male 32, female 53; age (45.31+/-11.72) years] were given live combined Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus and Enterococcus capsules 1260 mg/d t.i.d.x4 weeks. Syndrome scales were used to evaluate the efficacy in gastrointestinal syndrome. Fecal flora was also measured before and after the treatment. Six bacteria were cultured and the colony forming units were counted in stool. SPSS was used for data analysis. RESULTS: Seventy-four patients finished the follow-up. No side-effect was found. For treatment of irritable bowel syndrome, the effective rate of live combined Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus and Enterococcus capsules was 56.8% in the second week, 74.3% in the fourth week and 73.0% in the sixth week. Single symptom was improved, especially in abdominal pain and stool character. The probiotica containing live combined Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus and Enterococcus could increase bifidobacterium count (P<0.01) and lactobacillus count (P<0.05); decrease bacteroides count (P<0.05) and enterococci count (P<0.01); No obvious changes were observed in clostridium difficile colonitis and enterobacteriaceae (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: The result of the study indicated that the administration of live combined Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus and Enterococcus improved the symptom of irritable bowel syndrome and that there was a gradual increase of this effect. Thereafter conditions remained stable for 2 weeks. That improvement may be associated with alterations in gastrointestinal flora.",35.0

Many of these species are associated with the fermentation of dairy products. Despite their increasing use, the molecular details of the impact of various probiotic preparations on resident members of the gut microbiota and the host are generally lacking. To address this issue, we colonized germ-free mice with Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a prominent component of the adult human gut microbiota, and Bifidobacterium longum, a minor member but a commonly used probiotic. Simultaneous whole genome transcriptional profiling of both bacterial species in their gut habitat and of the intestinal epithelium, combined with mass-spectrometric analysis of habitat-associated carbohydrates, revealed that the presence of B. longum elicits an expansion in the diversity of polysaccharides targeted for degradation by B. thetaiotaomicron (e.g., mannose- and xylose-containing glycans), and induces host genes involved in innate immunity. Although the overall transcriptome expressed by B. thetaiotaomicron when it encounters B. longum in the cecum is dependent upon the genetic background of the mouse (as assessed by a mixed analysis of variance [ANOVA] model of co-colonization experiments performed in NMRI and C57BL/6J animals), B. thetaiotaomicron's expanded capacity to utilize polysaccharides occurs independently of host genotype, and is also observed with a fermented dairy product-associated strain, Lactobacillus casei. This gnotobiotic mouse model provides a controlled case study of how a resident symbiont and a probiotic species adapt their substrate utilization in response to one another, and illustrates both the generality and specificity of the relationship between a host, a component of its microbiota, and intentionally consumed microbial species. © 2006 Sonnenburg et al.",312.0

Ninety infants close to 4 months of age were randomized into one of three groups to be blindly assigned to receive for 13 weeks: a) an infant formula (Control), b) the same formula with fructo-oligosaccharides (Prebio), or c) with La1 (Probio). At the end of this period, all infants received the control formula for 2 additional weeks. Twenty-six infants, breastfed throughout the study, were recruited to form group BF. Fecal samples were obtained upon enrolment and after 7 and 15 weeks. Bacterial populations were assessed with classical culture techniques and fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH). Seventy-six infants completed the study. On enrolment, higher counts of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus and lower counts of enterobacteria were observed in BF compared to the formula-fed infants; these differences tended to disappear at weeks 7 and 15. No major differences for Clostridium, Bacteroides or Enterococcus were observed between the groups or along the follow up. Probio increased fecal Lactobacillus counts (P<0.001); 88% of the infants in this group excreted live La1 in their stools at week 7 but only 17% at week 15. Increased Bifidobacterium counts were observed at week 7 in the 3 formula groups, similar to BF infants. These results confirm the presence of higher counts of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli in the microbiota of BF infants compared to formula-fed infants before dietary diversification, and that La1 survives in the infant digestive tract.",52.0
"Salminen S., Isolauri E.","Intestinal colonization, microbiota, and probiotics",2006,Journal of Pediatrics,10.1016/j.jpeds.2006.06.062,"The human intestine is colonized by a large number of microorganisms that inhabit the intestinal tract and support a variety of physiological functions. The stepwise microbial colonization of the intestine begins at birth and continues during the early phases of life to form an intestinal microbiota that is different for each individual subject. This process facilitates the formation of a physical and immunologic barrier between the host and the environment, helping the gastrointestinal tract maintain a disease-free state. Probiotics are viable microbial food supplements that have a beneficial impact on human health. Health-promoting properties have been demonstrated for specific probiotic products. Scientific data are accumulating on these properties, especially in infants; the most significant effects include prevention and treatment of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and rotavirus diarrhea and allergy prevention. Bifidobacteria appear to be the most promising probiotic candidates, followed by defined lactic acid bacteria, which favor specific healthy bifidobacterial growth and species composition. Because viability appears to be important, probiotic properties also should be emphasized to meet this criterion. For future probiotics, the most important requirements include a demonstrated clinical benefit supported by mechanistic understanding of the effect on target population microbiota and immune functions. Genomic information and improved knowledge of microbiotic composition and its aberrancies should serve as a basis for selecting new probiotics for use in specific infant populations. © 2006 Mosby, Inc.

The effect of the synbiotic diets on intestinal microflora, concentration of organic acids, and the possibility of translocation of lactobacilli were also investigated. The LFM diet lowered serum total cholesterol and triglyceride levels, whereas the LM diet increased serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level. However, synbiotic diets did not contribute to a change in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level compared with the control diet. There was a decrease in the population of staphylococci, bacteroides, Escherichia coli, and total coliforms in most bowel regions with the LFM diet compared with the control (which did not contain any synbiotic). In general, the LFM diet contributed to a higher concentration of lactic acid that may have contributed to the decrease in the population of pathogenic microorganisms compared with the control. Fructooligosaccharide was the preferred substrate for production of acetic acid. Results from this study showed that the synbiotic diet that contained L. casei ASCC 292, fructooligosaccharide, and maltodextrin beneficially altered cholesterol levels and produced a healthier bowel microbial population without translocation of lactobacilli to other organs. © American Dairy Science Association, 2006.",123.0

Probiotics are commensals with special characteristics and may protect mucosal surfaces against pathogens. Pathogens cause significant phenotypic alterations in infected epithelial cells, and probiotics reverse these deleterious responses. We hypothesized that probiotics and/or commensals may also reverse epithelial damage produced by cytokines. Methods: Human intestinal epithelial cells were exposed basolaterally to interferon (IFN)-γ (103 U/mL) or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α (10 ng/mL) for up to 48 hours and assessed for ion transport, transepithelial resistance (TER), and epithelial permeability in the presence or absence of probiotics (Streptococcus thermophilus [ST] and Lactobacillus acidophilus [LA]), or the commensal, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (BT). Results: Agonist-stimulated chloride secretion was inhibited by IFN-γ, an effect prevented by ST/LA or BT. The ability of ST/LA or BT to restore Cl- secretion was blocked by inhibitors of p38 MAPK, ERK1, 2, and PI3K. The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and the NKCC1 cotransporter were down-regulated by IFN-γ, and ST/LA pretreatment reversed this effect. Both TNF-α and IFN-γ significantly reduced TER and increased epithelial permeability, effects prevented by ST/LA or BT. A Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor synergistically potentiated effects of ST/LA or BT on TER and permeability, but p38, ERK1, 2, or PI3K inhibition did not. Finally, only probiotic-treated epithelial cells exposed to cytokines showed reduced activation of SOCS3 and STAT1,3. Conclusions: Deleterious effects of TNF-α and IFN-γ on epithelial function are prevented by probiotic, and to a lesser extent, commensal pretreatment. These data extend the spectrum of effects of such bacteria on intestinal epithelial function and may justify their use in inflammatory disorders. © 2006 by the American Gastroenterological Association Institute.",235.0

Bifidogenic growth stimulator (BGS) is a prebiotic preparation produced by Propionibacterium freudenreichii isolated from Swiss cheese. Previously BGS was shown to act in the colon as a growth stimulator of Bifidobacteria. This study investigated the efficacy and safety of BGS in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Methods: Twelve patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis received orally 4.5 g of BGS daily for 4 wk in an open-label treatment protocol while the baseline anti-inflammatory therapy was continued. The response to treatment was evaluated clinically and endoscopically. Concentrations of short-chain fatty acids and the composition of commensal bacteria, including Bifidobacteria, Enterobacteria and Bacteroides species, were studied in stool samples. Results: Patients showed improvement in their clinical activity index scores, with a significant decrease in the score from 7.4 ± 2.8 to 4.7 ± 1.5 (mean ± standard error of the mean, P < 0.01). The endoscopic index score decreased from 4.4 ± 1.7 to 2.8 ± 1.8 (P < 0.05) with treatment. Patients showed an increase in stool butyrate concentrations after BGS treatment (P < 0.05). There were no significant changes in stool levels of bacteria as a result of BGS treatment. No side effects related to BGS were observed. Conclusions: Oral BGS therapy may represent a non-toxic way to treat ulcerative colitis. However, controlled studies are needed to demonstrate its efficacy in the treatment of this disorder. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",46.0

We used a chemiluminescence assay to explore if human faeces and different representative gut bacteria are able to generate NO. Bacteria were incubated anaerobically in gas-tight bags, with or without nitrate or nitrite in the growth medium. In addition, luminal NO levels were measured in vivo in the intestines in germ-free and conventional rats, and in rats mono-associated with lactobacilli. We show that human faeces can generate NO after nitrate or nitrite supplementation. Lactobacilli and bifidobacteria generated much NO from nitrite, but only a few of the tested strains produced NO from nitrate and at much lower levels. In contrast, Escherichia coli, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, and Clostridium difficile did not produce significant amounts of NO either with nitrate or nitrite. NO generation in the gut lumen was also observed in vivo in conventional rats but not in germ-free rats or in rats mono-associated with lactobacilli. We conclude that NO can be generated by the anaerobic gut flora in the presence of nitrate or nitrite.

"Heinemann C., Reid G.",Vaginal microbial diversity among postmenopausal women with and without hormone replacement therapy,2005,Canadian Journal of Microbiology,10.1139/W05-070,"Urogenital infections in postmenopausal women remain problematic. The use of estrogen replacement therapy has been shown to lower these infection rates, corresponding to increasing colonization by Lactobacillus species. Despite the gut's 500 microbial species and the proximity of the anus to the vagina, only a relatively few microbial strains appear to be able to colonize the urogenital area. In the present study, the sparsity of microbes in the vagina was confirmed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis of swabs taken at time zero and monthly for 3 months from 40 postmenopausal subjects receiving Premarin (conjugated equine estrogen in combination with progesterone) hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and 20 who were not on HRT. Lactobacilli were recovered from the vagina of 95% or more women in both groups, but in the HRT group, Lactobacillus were more often the dominant and only colonizers and significantly fewer bacteria with pathogenic potential were found. The incidence of bacterial vaginosis was significantly lower in the HRT group than in the non-HRT-treated women (5.6% versus 31%). The use of HRTs has recently come under criticism. The ability of drugs such as Premarin to help recover the lactobacilli vaginal microbiota appears to be at least one benefit of HRT use. In women not using HRTs, use of probiotics may be the only way to restore a nonpathogen-dominated flora. © 2005 NRC Canada.",95.0

In this study, we characterized the molecular mechanisms for the initial interaction of probiotic Bifidobacterium lactis strain BB12 with native and intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) lines. We showed that B. lactis-monoassociated Fisher F344 rats transiently induce phosphorylation/activation of the NF-κB transcriptionally active subunit RelA and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 in native IEC at day 5 after initial bacterial colonization. In addition, Interleukin 6 (IL-6) gene expression was significantly increased at day 5, demonstrating the physiological relevance of transient transcription factor activation in IEC. In contrast, Bacteroides vulgatus-monoassociated Fisher rats revealed RelA but not p38 MAPK phosphorylation and failed to trigger significant IL-6 gene expression in native IEC. Moreover, we demonstrated that B. lactis triggers NF-κB RelA and p38 MAPK phosphorylation in IEC lines. Adenoviral delivery of mutant IKK-β (Ad5dnIKKβ) and inhibition of the p38 MAPK pathway through the pharmacological inhibitor SB203580 significantly blocked B. lactis-induced IL-6 gene expression in IEC, suggesting that B. lactis triggers NF-κB and MAPK signaling to induce gene expression in the intestinal epithelium. Regarding the mechanisms of bacteria epithelial cell cross-talk, B. lactis-induced IL-6 gene expression was completely inhibited in TLR2 deficient mouse embryogenic fibroblasts (MEF TLR2-/-) as well as TLR2ΔTIR transfected Mode-K cells. In conclusion, we demonstrated that probiotic bacteria transiently trigger innate signal transduction and pro-inflammatory gene expression in the intestinal epithelium at early stages of bacterial colonization. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",94.0

This study evaluates how the ingestion of different amounts of La1 influences the main bacterial populations of the fecal microbiota. Eight asymptomatic volunteers participated in the study. After a basal period, they ingested daily 100 mL of a product containing 108 CFU mL-1 of La1 during the first week, 200 mL during the second week and 500 mL during the third week. Fecal samples were obtained at the end of each period and subsequently during 7 weeks. Lactobacilli were determined by culture on MRS agar and La1 colonies were confirmed by ERIC-PCR. The main populations of fecal bacteria were identified by FISH and flow cytometry. At baseline, 37.7% of the total fluorescent bacteria were Eubacterium rectale, 18.3% Fusobacterium prausnitzii, 13.2% Bacteroides, 8.6% Atopobium, 2.30%, Clostridium histolyticum, 2.05% Bifidobacterium and 0.95% Lactobacillus. Fecal excretion of La1 increased during the intake period and decreased during the post-ingestion period, so that no La1 was observed in the stools of the volunteers seven weeks after the intake product has been finished. La1 intake increased the populations of C. histolyticum (p = 0.049), Lactobacillus (p = 0.056) and Bifidobacterium (p = 0.067), and decreased those of F. prausnitzii (p = 0.005) while it did not affect Bacteroides, E. rectale and Atopobium populations. These bacterial populations returned to their baseline levels during the post-ingestion period.

Methods: A novel CEC: bacteria co-culture system was used to compare the ability of the colonic commensal bacteria, Bacteroides ovatus, E. coli (SLF) and Lactobacillus rhamnosus (LGG) to modulate production of different cytokines (n = 15) by primary CEC. Antibody staining and flow cytometry were used to investigate Toll-like receptor (TLR) expression by CEC directly ex vivo and TLR responsiveness was determined by examining the ability of TLR ligands to influence CEC cytokine production. Results: Primary CEC constitutively expressed functional TLR2 and TLR4. Cultured in complete medium alone, CEC secreted IL-6, MCP-1 and IP-10 the levels of which were significantly increased upon addition of the TLR ligands peptidoglycan (PGN) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Exposure to the commensal bacteria induced or up-regulated different patterns of cytokine production and secretion. E. coli induced production of MIP-1α/β and β defensin3 whereas B. ovatus and L. rhamnosus exclusively induced MCP-1 and MIP-2α expression, respectively. TNFα, RANTES and MEC were induced or up-regulated in response to some but not all of the bacteria whereas ENA78 and IP-10 were up-regulated in response to all bacteria. Evidence of bacterial interference and suppression of cytokine production was obtained from mixed bacterial: CEC co-cultures. Probiotic LGG suppressed E. coli and B. ovatus-induced cytokine mRNA accumulation and protein secretion. Conclusion: These observations demonstrate the ability of primary CEC to respond to and discriminate between different strains of commensal bacteria and identify a mechanism by which probiotic bacteria (LGG) may exert anti-inflammatory effects in vivo. © 2005 The WJG Press and Elsevier Inc.

Previous studies in adults have demonstrated that fructo-oligosaccharides increase potentially beneficial fecal bacteria, including bifidobacteria. The purpose of this study was to determine the prebiotic effect of infant formula supplemented with fructo-oligosaccharides. Methods: Healthy term infants 2 to 6 weeks of age were enrolled in a 5-week, prospective, randomized, crossover, single-site study with a nonrandomized human milk comparator group. Washout weeks preceded and followed a week of feeding with fructo-oligosaccharide-supplemented formula (1.5 or 3.0 g/L). Stool specimens were quantitatively cultured weekly for bacteroides, lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, clostridia and enterococci and were tested for Clostridium difficile toxin. Results: Seventy-two of 87 infants completed the trial; 58 were formula fed and 14 were human milk fed. Mean counts of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli were similar in all groups at entry and no group experienced a significant change in counts with fructo-oligosaccharide supplementation. After 7 days of fructo-oligosaccharide supplementation the bifidobacteria counts were greater in the 1.5 g/L fructo-oligosaccharide formula group than in the human milk fed or 3.0 g/L fructo-oligosaccharide formula groups. Formula-fed infants had higher counts of enterococci and bacteroides before fructo-oligosaccharide supplementation, and these counts did not change after supplementation. Clostridium counts increased 7 days after supplementation in the 1.5 g/L fructo-oligosaccharide formula group (P = 0.0356). No human milk fed infants had C. difficile toxin in stools. Fructo-oligosaccharide (3.0 g/L) supplementation resulted in more frequent and significantly softer stools.

The strain did not exhibit mucinolytic or other enzymatic activities that might be detrimental, such as those involving glycosidases (β-d-glucosaminidase or α-d- galactosidase) or arylamidases (factor Xa and quimotrypsin-like activities), frequently present in Lactobacillus strains isolated from patients with endocarditis, although it was able to express protein Ca and kallikrein-like activities. On the other hand, the presence of the strain did not interfere with the growth of certain species of normal intestinal microbiota, such as Enterococcus fecalis, Escherichia coli, Bifidobacterium bifidum or Bacteroides fragilis. Moreover, the potential probiotic strain UO 004 is sensitive to antibiotics with transmissible resistance mechanisms in Lactobacillus such as chloramphenicol, erythromycin, tetracycline and vancomycin. In addition, strain L. delbrueckii UO 004 was not able to translocate towards the intestinal barrier of mice or produce changes in their activity or general health status. © 2004 Elsevier SAS.

Changes in the microbial intestinal community composition and relative abundance of specific microbial populations in each subject were monitored by using viable counts and T-RFLP fingerprints. T-RFLP was also used to monitor specific bacterial populations that were either positively or negatively affected by clindamycin. Some dominant bacterial groups, such as Eubacterium spp., were easily monitored by T-RFLP, while they were hard to recover by cultivation. Furthermore, the two probiotic Lactobacillus strains were easily tracked by T-RFLP and were, shown to be the dominant Lactobacillus community members in the intestinal microflora of subjects who received the probiotic.",64.0

Knowledge of its microbial colonists and their beneficial/detrimental activities is important. However, generalized assumptions about the microbial composition of the human gut should be taken with caution until more studies in different human communities have been conducted. The capacity of modulating or inhibiting harmful populations through high doses of beneficial microorganisms (probiotics) is now an attractive possibility. Aims: The aim of this study was to determine the daily variation in the most prominent and representative of the cultivable microbial populations in the faeces of two healthy Spanish persons, with special reference to the lactic acid bacteria (lactobacilli and bifidobacteria). Faecal enzymatic activities caused or modulated by gut microorganisms were also examined. Methods: Microbial populations were enumerated in selective and differential media. LAB species isolated from MRS agar plates were further identified by phenotypic and genetic techniques. Enzymatic activities were measured by the semi quantitative method of the API ZYM system. Results: Obligate anaerobes (members of the Clostridium clusters and species of bacteroides and bifidobacteria) made up the largest bacterial populations in both individuals (ranging between 1010-1011 cfu/g of faeces) and remained constant over time. Lactobacilli species were found at an intermediate level (around 108 cfu/g), and yeasts and moulds, staphylococci, enterococci, coliforms and Enterobacteriaceae at a lower level (between 103 to 106 cfu/g). 38 lactic acid bacteria strains identified belonged to Bifidobacterium bifidum [19], Bifidobacterium longum [7], Bifidobacterium adolescentis [7] and Lactobacillus ruminis [5] species. Enzymatic profiles and values were shown to be personal and stable, but inter-sample fluctuations were recorded. Conclusions: The dominant microbial populations in the faeces of the two persons were similar and stable during the sampling period. Large differences were found in the lactic acid bacterial composition of each individual. Biochemistry seemed to be also personal and stable over time.",12.0

This study has determined the effect of the prebiotic carbohydrates oligofructose and inulin on the mucosal flora. Methods: An in vitro chemostat model of both planktonic and surface associated bacteria was used followed by an intervention study in 29 subjects undergoing colonoscopy. Subjects: Fourteen subjects, recruited from colonoscopy waiting lists, supplemented their diet for two weeks with a mix of 7.5 g of oligofructose and 7.5 g inulin. Fifteen subjects were recruited at the time of colonoscopy and given no supplement. Multiple endoscopic biopsies were taken from the caecum, transverse and descending colon, and rectum. The mucosal flora was characterised by culture and to species level by cellular fatty acid profiles. Cell proliferation was assessed by immunohistochemical staining for minichromosome maintenance protein 2, Ki67, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen. Results: In vitro prebiotics increased surface counts of bifidobacteria from 6.6 to 7.3 log10 colony forming units (CFU) per slide (p&lt;0.0006) with no significant changes in planktonic bacteria. In the feeding study, prebiotics increased mucosal bifidobacteria (log CFU/g mucosa (SEM)) in both the proximal (control 5.3 (0.4) v prebiotic 6.3 (0.3)) (p = 0.059) and distal (control 5.2 (0.3) v prebiotic 6.4 (0.3)) colon (p = 0.01).

Aim: To isolate and identify faecal bacteria capable of phytic acid metabolism and to assess the effectiveness of prebiotics (dietary oligosaccharides, metabolised by selective colonic bacteria) in preserving the integrity of phytic acid. Methods: Faecal samples from three volunteers were used in continuous culture experiments under varying conditions of pH, substrate concentration and dilution rates, seventy three different isolates cultured at steady state were then screened for phytic acid metabolism and identified through partial sequencing of their 16S rRNA genes (16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid). Utilisation of phytic acid was also assessed in a continuous culture system enriched with prebiotic fructooligosaccharides (FOS). Results: Bacteroides spp., Clostridium spp. and facultatively anaerobic bacteria generally appeared to maintain viable counts in the presence of phytic acid. Bifidobacterium spp. and Lactobacillus spp. appeared less able to maintain viable counts in the presence of phytic acid. These results were confirmed by an increase in viable counts of Bacteroides spp., Clostridium spp. and a decrease in viable counts of Bifidobacterium spp. and Lactobacillus spp. once phytic acid was introduced to a FOS enriched continuous culture.

Diagnosis is made using a series of tests or a Gram stain of a vaginal smear. Treatment with antibiotics is quite effective, but recurrences are common. A study of 55 vaginal samples from 11 postmenopausal women showed the presence of BV by the Gram stain-based Nugent scoring system, and polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis showed that Bacteroides or Prevotella species were the most common isolates recovered (24 of 25), with Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus agalactiae also found in some samples. In one case, only Gardnerella vaginalis was found. These findings illustrate that BV remains common even among otherwise healthy women, but it is not caused solely by either Gardnerella or Mobiluncus. Use of a FemExam™ system (Cooper Surgical, Shelton, CT), based upon elevated pH and trimethylamine levels, to screen vaginal smears from 59 healthy women showed poor correlation with the Gram stain method. A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of these subjects showed that the lactobacilli-dominant microbiota was restored in subjects with BV but not in controls, following 2 months of daily oral intake of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and Lactobacillusfermentum RC-14. These studies show that nucleic acid-based methods are effective at identifying bacteria responsible for BV. If such methods could be used to develop a commercially available, self-use kit, women would be much better placed to take control of their own health, for example, using medicinal food or dietary supplement products such as the clinically proven probiotic strains L. rhamnosus GR-1 and L fermentum RC-14.",60.0

This investigation was carried out in terms of a dose-response study. The chickens were naturally infected with avian Mycoplasma gallisepticum prior to the experiment. The BW gain, cecal pH, viscosity, and predominant microbial populations were measured 1 wk after the extract and APR treatments. The extracts and APR significantly stimulated growth of the chickens infected with avian Mycoplasma gallisepticum. The average BW gain of the groups fed with the extracts was significantly lower than that of the antibiotic group. The extracts had no significant effect on cecal pH. However, cecal viscosity and microbial populations were significantly affected by feeding extracts and antibiotic. In contrast to APR, the extracts stimulated the number of the potentially beneficial bacteria (bifidobacteria and lactobacilli), while reducing the number of the potentially harmful bacteria (Bacteroides spp. and Escherichia coli). Of the 3 extracts, LenE was associated with the most cecal bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. With each increase in the LenE dose, birds tended to have higher BW gain and total aerobe and anaerobe counts. Numbers of predominant cecal bacteria, in particular, E. coli, bifidobacteria, and lactobacilli, were significantly increased with increases in the LenE dose.

The aim of this study was to examine whether bacterial DNA can serve as the molecular basis for bacterial recognition. Methods: HT-29 monolayers were treated with various bacterial DNA and interleukin (IL)-8 secretion measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, nuclear factor κB activation by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and reporter assays, and IκB levels by Western blotting. Cytokine secretion in response to bacterial DNA was measured in murine colonic segments and splenocytes. IL-10-deficient mice were fed DNA from VSL probiotic compound daily for 2 weeks. Colons were removed and analyzed for cytokine production and inflammation. Results: HT-29 cells responded with IL-8 secretion to bacterial DNA in a differential manner. In the presence of proinflammatory stimuli, VSL3 DNA inhibited IL-8 secretion, reduced p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, delayed nuclear factor κB activation, stabilized levels of IκB, and inhibited proteasome function. VSL3 DNA inhibited colonic Interferon (IFN)-γ secretion In mouse colons and also attenuated a Bacteroides vulgatus-induced IFN-γ release from murine splenocytes. In mice, VSL3 DNA attenuated a systemic release of tumor necrosis factor α in response to Escherichia coli DNA injection. Treatment of IL-10-deficient mice with oral VSL3 DNA resulted in a reduction in mucosal secretion of tumor necrosis factor α and IFN-γ and an improvement in histologic disease.

The changes in these bacterial groups from previous studies were entered into the PI equation in order to determine a quantitative PI score. PI scores were than compared with the qualitative conclusions made in these publications. In general the PI scores agreed with the qualitative conclusions drawn and provided a quantitative measure. Conclusions: The PI allows the magnitude of prebiotic effects to be quantified rather than evaluations being solely qualitative.

Studies have shown that genistein is extensively degraded by the human gut microflora, presumably with a loss of its anti-carcinogenic action. The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential of a prebiotic to divert bacterial metabolism away from genistein breakdown: this may be of benefit to the host. Faecal samples were obtained from healthy volunteers and fermented in the presence of a source of soyabean isoflavones (Novasoy™ (10 g/l); ADM Neutraceuticals, Erith, Kent, UK). Bacterial genera of the human gut were enumerated using selective agars and genistein was quantified by HPLC. The experiment was repeated with the addition of glucose (10 g/l) or fructo-oligosaccharide (10 g/l; FOS) to the fermentation medium. The results showed most notably that counts of Bifidobacterium spp. and Lactobacillus spp. were significantly increased (P<0.05 and P<0.01 respectively) under steady-state conditions in the presence of FOS. Counts of Bacteroides spp. and Clostridium spp. were, however, both significantly reduced (P<0.05) during the fermentation. A decline in genistein concentration by about 52 and 56% over the 120 h culture period was observed with the addition of glucose or FOS to the basal medium (P<0.01), compared with about 91% loss of genistein in the vessels containing Novasoy™ (ADM Neutraceuticals) only. Similar trends were obtained using a three-stage chemostat (gut model), in which once again the degradation of genistein was about 22% in vessel one, about 24% in vessel two and about 26% in vessel three in the presence of FOS, compared with a degradation of genistein of about 67% in vessel one, about 95% in vessel two and about 93% in vessel three in the gut model containing Novasoy™ (ADM Neutraceuticals) only.

The effect of L. fermentum on representative microbial populations and overall metabolic activity of the human intestinal microbiota was investigated using a three-stage continuous culture system. Also, the use of galactooligosaccharides as a prebiotic to enhance growth and/or activity of the Lactobacillus strain was evaluated. Administration of L. fermentum resulted in a decrease in the overall bifidobacterial population (ca. 1 log unit). In the in vitro system, no significant changes were observed in the total bacterial, Lactobacillus, Bacteroides, and clostridial populations through L. fermentum supplementation. Acetate production decreased by 9 to 27%, while the propionate and butyrate concentrations increased considerably (50 to 90% and 52 to 157%, respectively). A general, although lesser, increase in the production of lactate was observed with the administration of the L. fermentum strain. Supplementation of the prebiotic to the culture medium did not cause statistically significant changes in either the numbers or the activity of the microbiota, although an increase in the butyrate production was seen (29 to 39%). Results from this in vitro study suggest that L. fermentum KC5b is a candidate probiotic which may affect cholesterol metabolism.

Methods: Thirty patients with compensated Child B liver cirrhosis were allocated into one of three matched groups, which were randomly given one of three 3-week oral treatments: (i) lactitol 20 g t.i.d.; (ii) 400 mg rifaximin b.i.d.; or (iii) the synbiotic SCM-III (Microflorana-F, Named, Lesmo, Italy) 10 mL t.i.d. Stool samples were collected at both the time of entry into the study and at the end of the trial period for the assessment of intestinal bacterial flora and for the determination of fecal pH and of organic acid concentration. Results: All three tested compounds significantly increased the total anaerobic bacterial count to the same extent. The change was mainly due to a reduction in the Bacteriodes population and an expansion of the bifidobacteria population. However, only SCM-III significantly decreased the total count of Bacteroides and Clostridium. Lactitol and SCM-III decreased (to a similar extent) the fecal pH compared with healthy controls and with pretreatment values (P < 0.05). Both lactitol and SCM-III produced a significant increase in the fecal concentration of acetic acid and lactic acid. However, only SCM-III decreased the fecal concentration of toxic short-chain fatty acids. Conclusions: In the present clinical study, we confirmed the findings from an in vitro study of enhanced-non-toxic organic acid recovery from stools during treatment with nonabsorbable disaccharides. In the present study, we found that lactitol did not produce any significant effect on Bacteroides and Clostridium, whereas the specific bacterial counts of such species significantly decreased only in the group treated with the synbiotic.

Peripheral blood cells (PB) were stimulated with either 'self' or 'non-self' preparations of faecal samples and isolated Bacteroides fragilis group-organisms (Bfg) or Escherichia coli (Esch. coli), and pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, IL-4, IL-6, IFN-γ, TNF-α) were measured in the culture supernatant.

A limited degree of success in controlling C. difficile infection has been achieved by using probiotics; however, prebiotics can also be used to change bacterial community structure and metabolism in the large gut, although the effects of these carbohydrates on suppression of clostridial pathogens have not been well characterized. The aims of this study were to investigate the bifidogenicity of three nondigestible oligosaccharide (NDO) preparations in normal and antibiotic-treated fecal microbiotas in vitro and their abilities to increase barrier resistance against colonization by C. difficile by using cultural and molecular techniques. Fecal cultures from three healthy volunteers were challenged with a toxigenic strain of C. difficile, and molecular probes were used to monitor growth of the pathogen, together with growth of bifidobacterial and bacteroides populations, over a time course. Evidence of colonization resistance was assessed by determining viable bacterial counts, short-chain fatty acid formation, and cytotoxic activity. Chemostat studies were then performed to determine whether there was a direct correlation between bifidobacteria and C. difficile suppression. NDO were shown to stimulate bifidobacterial growth, and there were concomitant reductions in C. difficile populations. However, in the presence of clindamycin, activity against bifidobacteria was augmented in the presence of NDO, resulting in a further loss of colonization resistance. In the absence of clindamycin, NDO enhanced colonization resistance against C. difficile, although this could not be attributed to bifidobacterium-induced inhibitory phenomena.",146.0

Lactobacilli treat human pouchitis and experimental colitis. We investigated if Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (L GG) can prevent colitis in TG rats monoassociated with B vulgatus and if L GG or Lactobacillus plantarum 299v (LP 299v) can treat established colitis in SPF TG rats and prevent recurrent disease after antibiotics were stopped. Methods: Germfree B27 TG rats were monoassociated with B vulgatus for four weeks following two weeks of colonisation with L GG or no bacteria. SPF B27 TG rats received oral vancomycin and imipenem for two weeks, or water alone, followed by four weeks of treatment with oral L GG, LP 299v, or water only. Disease activity was quantified by blinded gross and histological scores, caecal myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, and levels of interleukin (IL)-1β, tumour necrosis factor (TNF), transforming growth factor β, and IL-10. Results: L GG did not prevent colitis in B vulgatus co-associated TG rats or treat established disease in SPF rats. However, L GG but not LP 299v prevented colitis relapse in antibiotic treated rats with reduced gross and histological scores, caecal MPO, IL-1β, and TNF whereas caecal IL-10 was increased. Conclusions: L GG does not prevent colitis in gnotobiotic TG rats or treat established disease in SPF rats, but is superior to LP 299v in the prevention of recurrent colitis. These studies suggest that antibiotics and probiotic agents provide synergistic therapeutic effects, perhaps mediated by altered immunomodulation with selective activity of different lactobacillus species.",179.0

A panel of group-specific fluorescent in situ hybridization probes targeting 16S rRNA sequences revealed that the fermentors supported growth of a greater proportion of Bacteroides and a lower proportion of gram-positive anaerobes related to Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Ruminococcus flavefaciens-Ruminococcus bromii, Eubacterium rectale-Clostridium coccoides, and Eubacterium cylindroides than the proportions in the starting fecal inoculum. Nevertheless, certain substrates, such as dahlia inulin, caused a pronounced increase in the number of bacteria related to R. flavefaciens-R. bromii and E. cylindroides. The ability of three strictly anaerobic, gram-positive bacteria to compete with the complete human fecal flora was tested in the same experiment by using selective plating to enumerate the introduced strains. The Roseburia-related strain A2-183F was able to grow on all substrates despite the fact that it was unable to utilize complex carbohydrates in pure culture, and it was assumed that this organism survived by cross-feeding. In contrast, Roseburia intestinalis L1-82R and Eubacterium sp. strain A2-194R survived less well despite the fact that they were able to utilize polysaccharides in pure culture, except that A2-194R was stimulated 100-fold by inulin. These results suggest that many low-G+C-content gram-positive obligate anaerobes may be selected against during in vitro incubation, although several groups were stimulated by inulin. Thus, considerable caution is necessary when workers attempt to predict the in vivo effects of probiotics and prebiotics from their effects in vitro.",145.0

Objective: We conducted a randomised clinical trial of the use of a bifidobacteria-fermented milk (BFM) supplement as a dietary adjunct in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Methods: The subjects were randomly divided into two groups: a group with BFM supplementation (BFM group, 11 subjects) and a control group (control group, 10 subjects). The BFM group was given 100 mL/day of BFM for one year. Colonoscopies, general blood markers and examinations of intestinal flora including the analysis of fecal organic acids were performed at the commencement of the study and after one year. Results: Exacerbation of symptoms was seen in 3 out of 11 subjects in the BFM group and in 9 out of 10 in the control group. Log rank statistic analysis of the cumulative exacerbation rates showed a significant reduction in exacerbations for the BFM group (p = 0.0184).

With the primary aim of producing a standardised test system requiring a low animal cost, a single-stage continuous culture fermenter inoculated with porcine faecal material was shown to be capable of establishing and maintaining a microflora comparable to that of the porcine ileum. Such comparison was based upon total aerobic and anaerobic bacterial population magnitude, total Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium and Enterococcus spp., Escherichia coli and lactic acid bacteria numbers and E. coli strain complexity. The robustness of the model was demonstrated through resistance to transient pathogen (Salmonella poona) exposure. Test glycopeptide exposure (vancomycin) served both to verify the simulated microflora response as comparable with that reported elsewhere in vivo and to demonstrate the model's value in the assessment of dietary antimicrobial activity. The trends observed under antibiotic exposure illustrate the influence of vancomycin treatment on the enteric commensal microflora, inhibiting potentially probiotic bacteria that may be vital to the competitive exclusion of the gut and favouring the selection of opportunistic pathogens. Despite the limitations of such a model system, the in vitro porcine ileum produced highly repeatable data at a low cost, with complete control and containment. Given a comparable seeding inoculum the model proved capable of yielding data reproducible over time, describing the test antibiotics influence on the ileal microflora in a form suitable for comparison elsewhere. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Probiotics prevent the overgrowth of pathogens in the gut while polyamines enhance intestinal maturation. The aim of this randomized study was to investigate the ability of SB to modify the gut microbial ecology and its function. Methods: A total of 87 healthy babies with gestational age 28-32 weeks were studied. They were randomly assigned to receive a preterm formula to which SB or maltodextrins was added for 30 days. Evaluations were made on the following: SB tolerance and weight gain, faecal flora analysis, intestinal D-xylose absorption and faecal lipid excretion. Results: SB was well tolerated by the infants. There was no difference in weight gain between the two groups. Median log of colony forming units per gram of faeces for Escherichia coli and enterococci was significantly lower in the SB group [E. coli: 2.67 (0.045) vs. 2.75 (0.058), P<0.001; enterococci: 2.14 (0.359) vs. 2.19 (0.138), P<0.05].

As a result, Bifidobacterium infantis 1222 highly inhibited the growth of B. vulgatus in the coculture and also significantly suppressed the systemic antibody response raised by B. vulgatus colonizing the gut in gnotobiotic mice. Colonization of the mice by B. vulgatus increased the number of Peyer's patch (PP) cells bearing PNA (peanut agglutinin)+/anti-κ+ phenotype, which represents plasma cell-like B cells. Moreover, treatment of those B. vulgatus-implanted mice with B. infantis 1222 abrogated such increase in the number of PNA+/anti-κ+ cells.

However, for most candidate probiotic organisms there is a lack of evidence detailing their characterisation and effects on host flora and immunity. We have previously reported the isolation and characterisation, from surgically resected segments of the human gastrointestinal tract (GIT), of potential probiotic lactic acid bacteria (LAB). We have also described subsequent animal experiments that evaluated the establishment, persistence and localisation of specific probiotic Lactobacillus strains within the murine intestinal tract, in addition to their ability to influence the development of murine inflammatory disorders. In these studies, transit and survival of Lactobacillus salivarius UCC118 at the ileum was demonstrated using enteral tube sampling of six healthy volunteers following consumption of a single dose (150 ml) of fermented milk-borne probiotic (108 colony forming units per ml (CFU/ml)).

Throughout this feeding period, and for up to 100 days following cessation of feeding, the numbers of total culturable lactobacilli and of the administered Lactobacillus UCC118 present in faeces were monitored. Five subjects (5/40; fresh milk, four; fermented milk, one) were still excreting the probiotic lactobacilli 21 days post-cessation of feeding, while one subject (fermented milk) was still colonised up to 100 days after feeding. Consumption of fermented milk-borne UCC118 cells resulted in significantly increased levels of faecal-borne enterococci and lactobacilli. Numbers of bifidobacteria, coliforms and bacteroides were not significantly altered. In addition, changes in salivary IgA levels against UCC118 cells and increased granulocyte phagocytic activity were observed following consumption of the fermented milk-borne probiotic.

Our previous work on animals demonstrated that kanamycin use during infancy promotes a shift in the Thl/Th2 balance towards a Th2-dominant immunity. Objective: The first purpose of this study is to clarify whether or not the supplementation of intestinal bacteria can reverse such a Th2-skewed response induced by neonatal antibiotic use. The second objective is to elucidate the contribution of genetic factors to antibiotic-induced immunedeviation. Methods: BALB/c or C57BL/6 mice at 3 weeks of age were orally administered 600 μg/day of kanamycin sulphate for seven consecutive days. Thereafter, the mice were inoculated with one type of intestinal bacterial species: Enterococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus acidophilus or Bacteroides vulgatus. Blood samples were collected 10 weeks after the cessation of kanamycin treatment, and the effect of the kanamycin treatment on Thl/Th2 balance was evaluated based on in vivo antibody levels. Results: A kanamycin-induced elevation of the serum IgE levels was reversed by the supplementation with Enterococcus faecalis, and to a lesser extent by that with Lactobacillus acidophilus. The IgE/IgG2a ratio in the mice supplemented with Enterococcus faecalis significantly decreased in comparison with that in the kanamycin-treated mice without any bacterial supplementation, while such a ratio was enhanced in the mice inoculated with Bacteroides vulgatus. No antibiotic-induced Th2-skewed response was seen in C57BL/6 mice that are genetically biased towards Thl-dominant immunity. Conclusion: These results suggest that adequate probiotic intervention after antibiotic treatment may improve the intestinal ecosystem, and thereby prevent the Th2-shifted immunity induced by neonatal antibiotic use. In addition, the difference of genetic backgrounds also contributes to such an antibiotic-induced Th2-skewed response.",89.0

Aims: Our aims were to characterise the relationship between gut microbes and the extent of allergic sensitisation and to assess whether the efficacy of bifidobacterial supplementation in the treatment of allergy could relate to modulation of the intestinal microbiota. Methods: This randomised study included 21 infants with early onset atopic eczema of whom eight were intolerant (highly sensitised group (HSG)) and 13 tolerant (sensitised group (SG)) to extensively hydrolysed whey formula (EHF). In the SG, six were weaned to EHF without (placebo group (PG)) and seven to EHF with Bifidobacterium lactis Bb-12 supplementation (bifidobacteria treated group (BbG)). The faecal microflora of infants in the HSG was analysed only before weaning whereas in the SG the faecal microflora was analysed both before and after weaning. Results: Infants in the HSG had greater numbers of lactobacilli/enterococci than those in the SG. Serum total IgE concentration correlated directly with Escherichia coli counts in all infants and with bacteroides counts in the HSG, indicating that the presence of these bacteria is associated with the extent of atopic sensitisation. The effect of supplementation was characterised as a decrease in the numbers of Escherichia coli and protection against an increase in bacteroides numbers during weaning. Conclusions: These data indicate that bifidobacterial supplementation appears to modify the gut microbiota in a manner that may alleviate allergic inflammation.

The population of bifidobacteria increased significantly, while there was a significant decrease in numbers of the Erec group. The FISH analysis of the probiotic study focused on the enumeration of bifidobacteria only, which did not increase significantly during the study. Samples collected in both studies were analyzed by Bifidobacterium-specific PCR and DGGE. The results showed that a stable bifidobacterial population was present throughout each study.

In this investigation, bacteria were isolated from faecal samples from healthy young adults and elderly subjects, and elderly patients with Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea (CDAD). The organisms were identified to species level on the basis of their cellular fatty acid profiles with the MIDI system. In some groups of bacteria, species diversity was found to change with age despite the overall numbers of organisms being similar at genus level. Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, B. ovatus and Prevotella tannerae were common gram-negative anaerobes isolated from young adults. Bacteroides species diversity increased in the faeces of healthy elderly people. Bifidobacterial species diversity decreased with age, with Bifidobacterium adolescentis and Bif. angulatum being the most common isolates. CDAD patients were characterised by greater diversity of facultative species, lactobacilli and clostridia, but greatly reduced numbers of bacteroides, prevotella and bifidobacteria. Such bacterial population changes in the normal microbiota could result in metabolic conditions favourable for the establishment of pathogenic micro-organisms, such as clostridia, and would have considerable effects on the biochemical capacity of the large intestine as a whole.

An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed by MANOVA and ANCOVA. Bifidobacterium breve C50 cells were never found in the intestine or in the internal organs. Lactobacilli numbers were increased in the caecum and colon, while Bacteroides fragilis group counts showed a decrease in the colon. A similar modification to caecal and colonic floras was demonstrated following cell-free whey intake, except in the case of the colonic Lactobacilli where no increase was observed. Translocation commonly occured in all mouse groups. The most common bacteria contaminating Peyer's patches were lactobacilli. It is likely that they were of median and distal ileal origin (p = 0.0001). ANOVA also suggested that lactobacilli from the distal ileum translocated to the liver (p = 0.0001) and from the liver to the lungs (p = 0.0027), according to the product the animals ingested.

Faecal microbial analysis was performed weekly to enumerate excretion of the probiotic UCC118, total lactobacilli, Clostridium perfringens, bacteroides, coliforms, bifidobacteria and enterococci. At sacrifice, the small and large bowel were microbiologically and histologically assessed. Results: L. salivarius UCC118 was detected in faeces from all mice in the probiotic fed group, but not the control group. Faecal coliform and enterococci levels were significantly reduced in probiotic fed animals compared to the controls (P < 0.05). At sacrifice, a significant reduction in C. perfringens numbers was observed in the test mice (P < 0.05). There were no fatalities in the test group compared to two deaths from fulminant colitis in the control group. Only one test mouse developed colonic adenocarcinoma compared to five in the control group. Test animal mucosal inflammation consistently scored lower than that of the control mice. Conclusion: In this placebo controlled trial, modification of enteric flora in IL-10 knockout mice by probiotic lactobacilli was associated with reduced prevalence of colon cancer and mucosal inflammatory activity.",240.0

Methods and Results: The substrates were incubated in 24 h batch culture fermentations of human faecal bacteria. Fluorescent in situ hybridization was used to determine changes in populations of bifidobacteria, lactobacilli, clostridia, bacteroides, streptococci and Escherichia coli. Gas and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production was also measured. GOS gave the largest significant increases in bifidobacteria, lactobacilli and total bacterial numbers during the incubations. However, FOS appeared to be a more selective prebiotic as it did not significantly stimulate growth of bacterial groups which were not probiotic in nature. GOS and maltodextrin produced the highest levels of SCFA. Lowest gas production was seen with GOS and highest with FOS. Conclusions: GOS possessed bifidogenic activity in vitro. Although fermentation of GOS was not as selective as FOS, gas production was lower. Gas production is often seen as an undesirable side effect of prebiotic consumption. Significance and Impact of the Study: The study has provided the first data on fermentation of GOS in mixed faecal culture. The study has also used molecular microbiology methods (FISH) to quantify bacterial groups. The data extend our knowledge of the selectivity of fermentation of oligosaccharides by the gut microflora.",75.0

It was proven that bacterial strains from the intestine occur at extraintestinal sites after liver injury. Lactobacillus spp. dominated the intestinal flora and were also the most frequently found genus in the liver and the mesenteric lymph nodes. Some of the blood isolates, identified as Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris and Bacteroides merdae, were not found as a dominating part of the mucosal flora.

Therefore, the colonic bacteria and the dimensions and transport functions of the small intestine were compared among mice (B6C 3F1 strain) fed diets with 10% cellulose (control) or with the cellulose replaced entirely with the NDO inulin or oligofructose or partially (2.5% oligofructose and 7.5% cellulose). Mice fed diets with 10% inulin or oligofructose had higher densities of anaerobes, aerobes, bacteroides, and lactobacilli, and lower proportions of enterics than mice fed a diet with 10% cellulose. Inulin, but not oligofructose, resulted in higher densities of Streptococci. The small intestine was longer and weighed more when mice were fed 10% inulin with intermediate values for 10% oligofructose. Relative to control mice, rates of glucose transport and absorption of leucine, proline and glycyl-sarcosine (nmol/mg-min) were lower when mice were fed diets with 10% oligofructose and inulin, whereas only leucine was lower when mice were fed the diet with 2.5% oligofructose. Our findings indicate supplementing diets with the NDO oligofructose and inulin 1) change the assemblages of colonic bacteria, 2) influence the dimensions and absorptive functions of the small intestine, and 3) may be useful for managing the gastrointestinal ecosystem, but 4) the specific responses vary among the types and amounts of NDO and among animal models.",5.0

Bif. longum MK-G7 showed the highest acid tolerance against HCl and acetic acid, whereas Bif. infantis Y-1 showed the lowest acid tolerance and more than 4 log cycles of viable cell count decreased due to acid injury. Viable cell counts of bifidobacteria strains decreased more than 1.5 log cycles owing to oxygen toxicity, with the exception of Bif. longum MK-G7, Bif. infantis Y-2, Bif. longum Y-3, Bif. longum Y-6, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus Y-7. Among the bifidobacteria strains tested, Bif. infantis Y-2, Bif. longum Y-3, Bif. longum Y-6, and Bif. longum RD-13 showed the highest bile tolerance, whereas Bif. longum MK-G7 showed a medium level of bile tolerance. Only Bif. longum MK-G7 showed much higher antibiotic resistance against both tetracycline and penicillin-G in the MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) level of 24.8 mg/l and 0.52 mg/l, respectively. Bif. longum MK-G7 showed a higher degree of in vitro cholesterol assimilation, followed by Bif. breve ATCC 15700 and Bif. longum RD-13. Bif. longum MK-G7, Bif. lactis Y-4, Bif. longum Y-6, and Bif. bifidum ATCC 29539 showed more than 80% of anti-mutagenicity against NQO (4- nitroquinoline-1-oxide). Since the production of cytokines such as TNF (tumor necrosis factor)-α and IL (interleukin)-6, and NO (nitric oxide) in the macrophage cell line Raw 264.7 cells increased as Bif. longum MK-G7 cell concentration increased, it was suggested that Bif. longum MK-G7 is able to enhance immunopotentiating activity in vitro. When freeze-dried Bif. longum MK-G7 was administered to mice at the dose of 1, 2, 4, and 6 g/kg of body weight, all of the mice survived in all feeding groups, proving the GRAS (generally recognized as safe) status of Bif. longum MK-G7. When fermented milk containing Bif. longum MK-G7 was administered to human volunteers, viable cell count of total bifidobacteria and anaerobes in the feces increased up to 0.5 log cycles more than before the administration. In particular, Bif. longum MK-G7 inhibited the growth of Bacteroides at the level of 1.0-1.5 log cycles.",7.0

Rabbits were immunized with heat-killed DN-173 010 bacteria resulting in the production of an antiserum highly specific for bacteria belonging to: Bif. animalis species. Of the 89 strains representative of 29 different bifidobacterial species tested, only the 15 strains of the Bif. animalis species could be detected with the antiserum. In Western immunoblotting the serum reacts with a protein of 45-kDa apparent molecular weight. None of the bacteria classically encountered in human faecal samples and able to grow on non-selective Columbia blood agar (enterobacteria, Bacteroides or Lactobacillus for instance) reacted with the antiserum. Taking advantage of the high specificity of the antiserum and of the absence of Bif. animalis bacteria in faeces samples of five human volunteers, we demonstrated that strain DN-173 010 survives the intestinal transit. Being based on a combination of semiselective cultivation and colony immunoblotting techniques, the method allowed detection of the Bif. animalis strain even when it represented only one thousandth of the total bifidobacterial population.",34.0

The hydrolyzing potential was related to the number of anaerobes, especially Bacteroides/Prevotella. GBC mice were established by 6-generation inbreeding under control of hydrolyzing potential. The male mice were administered 1, 2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH) and either Ginseng or M1 orally. DMH treatment induced aberrant crypts (AC) in the colorecta of all control mice 7 weeks after initial treatment, whereas Ginseng treatment decreased the number of AC by 43% (p <0.02). Fifteen weeks later, AC counts in the control mice became more than double and all mice had colon carcinomas. In contrast, M1 given AC bearing mice prevented tumorigenesis of AC by 80% (p < 0.03). The amount of M1 in the colorecta was sufficient for inhibition of tumor growth in vitro. These results suggest that intestinal bacteria hydrolyze Ginseng to an anticarcinogen, rendering the mice resistant to the carcinogen.",9.0

Clinical and experimental observations have suggested the potential role of probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease therapy, Aim: To evaluate the effects on intestinal microflora and the clinical efficacy of a new probiotic preparation in patients with ulcerative colitis in remission. Patients and methods: Twenty patients with ulcerative colitis, intolerant or allergic to 5-ASA, have been treated with a new probiotic preparation (VSL 3, CSL, Milan, Italy) containing 5 x 1011 cells/g of 3 strains of bifidobacteria, 4 strains of lactobacilli and 1 strain of Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus. Two doses of 3 g were administered o.d. for 12 months. Faecal samples for stool culture were obtained from the patients at the beginning of the trial and after 10, 20, 40, 60, 75, 90 days, 12 months and at 15 days after the end of the treatment. The following bacterial groups have been evaluated in the faeces: total aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, enterococci. Streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, Bacteroides, clostridia, coliforms. Patients were assessed clinically every two months, and assessed endoscopically at 6 and 12 months or in relapse. Results: Faecal concentrations of Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus, lactobacilli and bifidobacteria increased significantly in all patients, compared to their basal level, from the 20th day of treatment (P &lt; 0.05) and remained stable throughout the study. Concentrations of Bacteroides, clostridia, coliforms, total aerobic and anaerobic bacteria did not change significantly during treatment (P = N.S.). Fifteen of 20 treated patients remained in remission during the study, one patient was lost to follow up, while the remaining relapsed. No significant side-effects have been reported. Conclusions: These results show that this probiotic preparation is able to colonize the intestine, and suggest that it may be useful in maintaining the remission in ulcerative colitis patients intolerant or allergic to 5-ASA. Controlled trials are warranted to confirm these preliminary results.",486.0

Furthermore, allergic disease is less common among children in the formerly socialist countries of central and Eastern Europe as compared with Western Europe. It has been suggested that a reduced microbial stimulation during infancy and early childhood would result in a slower postnatal maturation of the immune system and development of an optimal balance between TH1- and TH2-like immunity. Aims: To test the hypothesis that allergic disease among children may be associated with differences in their intestinal microflora in two countries with a low (Estonia) and a high (Sweden) prevalence of allergy. Methods: From a prospective study of the development of allergy in relation to environmental factors, 29 Estonian and 33 Swedish 2-year-old children were selected. They were either nonallergic (n = 36) or had a confirmed diagnosis of allergy (n = 27) as verified by typical history and at least one positive skin prick test to egg or cow's milk. Weighed samples of faeces were serially diluted (10- 2-10-9) and grown under anaerobic conditions. The counts of the various genera and species were calculated for each child. In addition, the relative amounts of the particular microbes were expressed as a proportion of the total count. Results: The allergic children in Estonia and Sweden were less often colonized with lactobacilli (P&lt;0.01), as compared with the nonallergic children in the two countries. In contrast, the allergic children harboured higher counts of aerobic micro-organisms (P &lt; 0.05), particularly coliforms (P&lt;0.01) and Staphylococcus aureus (P&lt;0.05). The proportions of aerobic bacteria of the intestinal flora were also higher in the allergic children (P &lt; 0.05), while the opposite was true for anaerobes (P &lt; 0.05). Similarly, in the allergic children the proportions of coliforms were higher (P &lt; 0.05) and bacteroides lower (P &lt; 0.05) than in the nonallergic children. Conclusions: Differences in the indigenous intestinal flora might affect the development and priming of the immune system in early childhood, similar to what has been shown in rodents. The role of intestinal microflora in relation to the development of infant immunity and the possible consequences for allergic diseases later in life requires further study, particularly as it would be readily available for intervention as a means for primary prevention of allergy by the administration of probiotic bacteria.",774.0

Nitroreductase and β-glucuronidase activities were assessed as risk indexes for colon carcinogenesis, and β-galactosidase was measured as an indicator of the fermentation capacity of the colonic flora. Fecal excretion of Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, and clostridial spores decreased after 7 d of consumption of either preparation; however, counts of bifidobacteria only increased after intake of B. breve whey.
